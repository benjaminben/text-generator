INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but –

YOUNG WOMAN
– but you forget about it in a day
or two -

YOUNG MAN
– yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I'm doin' fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier!  Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: "We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er."

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl – the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
"Empty out the register," and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
"Garcon" means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I'm ready, let's go, right here,
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

"PULP FICTION"

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS
down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front
seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both
wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long
green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES
WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
– Okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause – get a load of
this – if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it.

VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know
what the funniest thing about Europe
is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there,
they wouldn't know what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What'd they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
Le Big Mac. What do they call a
Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
King.  But you know what they put on
french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
little bit on the side of the plate,
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
Uuccch!

                              CUT TO:

INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I'm not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up there?

JULES
It's possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What's her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What's a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don't watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait
for the elevator.

JULES
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him
Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT
Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call the
brother fat. He's got a weight
problem.  What's the nigger gonna
do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT
I think I know who you mean, what
about him?

JULES
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
good.  And word around the campfire,
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

VINCENT
What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES
No no no no no no no, nothin' that
bad.

VINCENT
Well what then?

JULES
He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT
A foot massage?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
That's all?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
What did Marsellus do?

JULES
Sent a couple of guys over to his
place.  They took him out on the
patio of his apartment, threw his
ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell
four stories. They had this garden
at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
like one of them greenhouses – nigger
fell through that. Since then, he's
kinda developed a speech impediment.

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

VINCENT
That's a damn shame.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
down the hall.

VINCENT
Still I hafta say, play with matches,
ya get burned.

JULES
Whaddya mean?

VINCENT
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES
You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT
Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react like he did, but
he had to expect a reaction.

JULES
It was a foot massage, a foot massage
is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage.

VINCENT
It's laying hands on Marsellus
Wallace's new wife in a familiar
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
– no, but you're in the same fuckin'
ballpark.

Jules stops Vincent.

JULES
Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES
It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES
Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages – I'm the foot fuckin'
master.

VINCENT
Given a lot of 'em?

JULES
Shit yeah. I got my technique down
man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?

Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

JULES
Fuck you.

He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a
little bit behind.

VINCENT
How many?

JULES
Fuck you.

VINCENT
Would you give me a foot massage –
I'm kinda tired.

JULES
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
pissed – this is the door.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They
whisper.

JULES
What time is it?

VINCENT
(checking his watch)
Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
still whispering.

JULES
Look, just because I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage, don't make it
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
way the nigger talks. That ain't
right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT
I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
but you know it and she knows it,
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
have a sense of humor about that
shit.

JULES
That's an interesting point, but
let's get into character.

VINCENT
What's her name again?

JULES
Mia. Why you so interested in big
man's wife?

VINCENT
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
and when he's gone, he wants me to
take care of Mia.

JULES
Take care of her?

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

VINCENT
Not that! Take her out. Show her a
good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
out on a date?

VINCENT
It ain't a date. It's like when you
and your buddy's wife go to a movie
or somethin'. It's just... you know...
good company.

Jules just looks at him.

VINCENT
It's not a date.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

JULES
Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: "No."

JULES
We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

JULES
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?

VINCENT
No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

JULES
You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT
I ain't hungry.

JULES
Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast
food drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN
It's under the be –

JULES
– I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

ROGER
It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
a black snap briefcase.

VINCENT
Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
just stares at it, transfixed.

JULES
We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

JULES
Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

JULES
We happy?

Closing the case.

VINCENT
We're happy.

BRETT
(to Jules)
Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit.

BRETT
I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions –

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

JULES
(to Brett)
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that.  Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about "best
intentions."

Brett can't say a word.

JULES
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
front of an interrogator.

JULES
What country you from!

BRETT
(petrified)
What?

JULES
"What" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in "What?"

BRETT
(near heart attack)
What?

JULES
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

BRETT
(out of fear)
What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
cheek.

JULES
Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What"
again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say "What" one more
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

JULES
Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

BRETT
Well he's... he's... black –

JULES
– go on!

BRETT
...and he's... he's... bald –

JULES
– does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT
(without thinking)
What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in
the chair.

JULES
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT
(in agony)
No.

JULES
Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!

BRETT
(in spasm)
I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

JULES
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT
(in spasm)
Yes.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you."

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
Brett.

AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

FADE IN:

MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old
prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue
high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is
everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds
like a cross between a gangster and a king.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I think you're gonna find – when all
this shit is over and done – I think
you're gonna find yourself one smilin'
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right
now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don't last. Now
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of
life, but it's a fact of life your
ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass
aged like wine.  Besides, even if
you went all the way, what would you
be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you
can even get a credit card based on
that.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front
of Butch. Butch picks it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Now the night of the fight, you may
fell a slight sting, that's pride
fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride
only hurts, it never helps. Fight
through that shit. 'Cause a year
from now, when you're kickin' it in
the Caribbean you're gonna say,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

BUTCH
I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Butch nods his head: "yes."

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Say it!

BUTCH
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

                              CUT TO:

INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964
cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio,
ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus
owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
LeRoy's.

ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door
in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave
crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT
Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE
He's over there, finishing up some
business.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with
his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of
yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go
on over.  In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?

VINCENT
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'
American?

ENGLISH DAVE
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia
out tomorrow?

VINCENT
At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE
Have you met Mia?

VINCENT
Not yet.

English Dave smiles to himself.

VINCENT
What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE
Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit
across a table, chew my food with my
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and
that's all I'm gonna do.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

ENGLISH DAVE
My name's Paul, and this is between
y'all.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his
cup of "Plain ol' American."

BUTCH
(to English Dave)
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE
Filters?

BUTCH
Non.

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his
coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

BUTCH
Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT
I ain't your friend, palooka.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

BUTCH
What was that?

VINCENT
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure
that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend
of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays
English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

CLOSEUP – JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of
her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in
her lips, eyebrows and nose.

JODY
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
book on body piercing.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is
at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

TRUDI
You know how they use that gun when
they pierce your ears? They don't
use that when they pierce your
nipples, do they?

JODY
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing. All
of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of 'em done with a
needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One
through my right nostril.  One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
my tongue.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
and out the other, until that last remark.

VINCENT
(interrupting)
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
curious, why would you get a stud in
your tongue?

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
thing in the world.

JODY
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent
to ponder the truth of her statement.

LANCE (O.S.)
Vince, you can come in now!

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly
appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly
personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult
life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and
has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a
"Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

LANCE
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very
good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce – those are friend
prices – but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went.  Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
madman.

VINCENT
Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam.

LANCE
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No.  You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT
That's a bold statement.

LANCE
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse
to death.

VINCENT
Give me three hundred worth of the
madman.  If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
high?

VINCENT
Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?

LANCE
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."

VINCENT
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE
No problem?

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
up).

VINCENT
You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE
Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT
Mucho gracias.

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

LANCE
Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT
You know what some fucker did to it
the other day?

LANCE
What?

VINCENT
Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE
Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days – five days,
and some dickless piece of shit fucks
with it.

LANCE
They should be fuckin' killed. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

As he cooks his heroin...

VINCENT
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck
another man's vehicle.

CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP – BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB

Pushing down on the plunger.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door

CLOSEUP – NOTE

The Note reads:

"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside
and make yourself a drink.  Mia"

MIA (V.O.)
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open. Come inside and
make yourself a drink.

                        FADE TO WHITE

Music in.

                             FADE TO:

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent enters on the background.

VINCENT
Hello?

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in
the background. Dusty Springfield is singing "SON OF A
PREACHER MAN".

Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone.

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent turns.

MIA
(over intercom)
Vincent. I'm on the intercom.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
It's on the wall by the two African
fellas.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
To your right.

Vincent walks.

MIA
...warm. Warmer. Disco.

Vincent finds the intercom on the wall.

VINCENT
Hello.

MIA
(over intercom)
Push the button if you want to talk.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Hello.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
Go make yourself a drink., and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's
tail.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
The bar's by the fireplace.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Okay.
(licks lips)

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty
Springfield song continues.

Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video
camera in Marcellus' living room.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle,
and then pours it into a glass.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

Mia sniffs the cocaine.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the
wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record.
The Dusty Springfield song stops.

MIA
Let's go.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?

MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.

VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
the wall

("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF
THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting
a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
you please me."

BUDDY
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
vanilla coke.

BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger –
bloody – and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA
Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar
shake?

MIA
Sure did.

VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA
Uh-huh.

VINCENT
It costs five dollars?

BUDDY
Yep.

VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or
anything?

BUDDY
Nope.

VINCENT
Just checking.

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
fool.

MIA
Whaddya think?

VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse
rate.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him 

MIA
What are you doing?

VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.

MIA
Here?

VINCENT
It's just tobacco.

MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
me one, cowboy?

As he finishes licking it –

VINCENT
You can have this one, cowgirl.

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
hand. He lights it.

MIA
Thanks.

VINCENT
Think nothing of it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

MIA
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam.

VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT
What was it?

MIA
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

VINCENT
What?

MIA
"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show "Baton Rouge," she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me.  We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
was sex...

VINCENT
What was your specialty?

MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist – when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA
Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT
Tell me.

MIA
No. It's really corny.

VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed.

VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh.

MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know
it.

MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?

VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
much.

VINCENT
What a gyp.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
the straw of her shake.

MIA
Yummy!

VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
tastes like.

MIA
Be my guest.

She slides the shake over to him.

MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA
Kooties I can handle.

He takes a sip.

VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
good milk shake.

MIA
Told ya.

VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
good.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

MIA
Don't you hate that?

VINCENT
What?

MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT
I don't know.

MIA
That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence.

VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
other.

MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
the bathroom and powder my nose,
while you sit here and think of
something to say.

VINCENT
I'll do that.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you?

VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroe's section.

MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn
Monroes.

VINCENT
No there's not.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe...

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

VINCENT
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off.

MIA
Pretty smart.

VINCENT
I have moments.

MIA
Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you.

MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say.

VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get
offended.

MIA
You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.

MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT
Is that a fact?

Mia nods her head: "Yes."

MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you
don't have permission.

VINCENT
What do you think about what happened
to Antwan?

MIA
Who's Antwan?

VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA
He fell out of a window.

VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.

MIA
Is that a fact?

VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA
Who told you this?

VINCENT
They.

Mia and Vincent smile.

MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT
They certainly do.

MIA
Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?

Vincent is slow to answer.

MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it
involve the F-word?

VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage.

MIA
And...?

VINCENT
No and, that's it.

MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?

VINCENT
Yeah.

MIA
And you believed that?

VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.

MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you.

MIA
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT
But did it happen?

MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding
– then never again.  The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing
circle.

                              CUT TO:

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
contest.

Patrons cheer.

Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...Now, who will be our first
contestants?

Mia holds her hand.

MIA
Right here.

Vincent reacts.

MIA
I wanna dance.

VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
believe Marsellus, my husband, your
boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy.

VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.

MIA
So, dance good.

VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first
contestants.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
is your name?

MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can
do. Take it away!

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".
They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
ahead.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
face.

MIA
(like you would say
Bingo!)
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.

                              CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
himself in the mirror.

VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.

LIVING ROOM

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
fat line.

CLOSEUP – MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
dialogue with the mirror.

VINCENT
...It's a moral test of yourself,
whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
meaningful.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening," go home, and
jack off.  And that's all you're
gonna do.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Slack-jawed.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

VINCENT
(yelling to Mia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on
your feet.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting
like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when
he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag
of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches
a number.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,
CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in
an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
Stooges, and they're getting married.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call this late!

LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is?
You're not supposed to be callin' me
this fuckin' late.

                             BACK TO:

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
conversation.

VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
to your place.

LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
the problem?

VINCENT
You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.

VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's
fuckin'  Doing on me.

LANCE
Don't bring her here!  I'm not even
fuckin' joking with you, don't you
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
to my house!

VINCENT
No choice.

LANCE
She's ODin'?

VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT
Negative.

LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
fucked her up, you deal with it –
are you talkin' to me on a cellular
phone?

VINCENT
Sorry.

LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't
come here, I'm hangin' up.

VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out
of SHATTERS from the impact.

JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front
lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
out.

LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone –

VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!

LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
through the hall into the living room.

JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
out here?

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference
here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

JODY
Who's she?

Lance looks up at Jody.

LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I
have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY
What's wrong with her?

VINCENT
She's ODing on us.

JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY
Don't yell and me!

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking
for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
get a medical book.

VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years
and you never used it?

LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT
Well then get it.

LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
to her.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
"Come on," endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.

Jody calls to LANCE.

JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?

LANCE
My black medical book!

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
Jody appears in the doorway.

JODY
Whata're you looking for?

LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY
I never saw a medical book.

LANCE
Trust me, I have one.

JODY
Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?

Lance spins toward her.

LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're
never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling
you to clean this room –

VINCENT (O.S.)
– get your ass in here, fuck the
book!

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
reenters the room.

VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her
the shot!

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt
off and find her heart.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?

LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
her an injection in the heart, so I
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her
heart is, I think it's here.

Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and
nods.

LANCE
That's it.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got
one?

JODY
What?

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
would be great.

JODY
Hold on.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to
do.

VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT
I've never does this before.

LANCE
I've never done this before either,
and I ain't starting now. You brought
'er here, that means you give her
the shot. The day I bring an ODing
bitch to your place, then I gotta
give her the shot.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
marker in her hand.

JODY
Got it.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?

LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce
through that. So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The
Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

VINCENT
I gotta stab her?

LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart, you gotta stab
her hard.

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

VINCENT
What happens after that?

LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it
like –
(snaps his fingers)
– that.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

VINCENT
Count to three.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know
what to expect.

LANCE
One...

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...two...

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...three!

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline
out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck
in her chest – SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of
air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

LANCE
If you're okay, say something.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
relatively normal voice.

MIA
Something.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
shaking from how close to death Mia came.

JODY
Anybody want a beer?

                              CUT TO:

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says
anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
toward her front door.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
distance between the two.

VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?

MIA
What's yours?

VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident.

Mia smiles.

MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you.

VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.

MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT
Let's shake on it.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
shake and shake they do.

VINCENT
Mum's the word.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

MIA
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE
FIVE" joke?

Vincent turns around.

VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh.

MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT
I can't wait.

MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him –
(stamps on the ground)
– and says: catch up.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

                        FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP On the cartoon "SPEED RACER."  Speed is giving a
detailed description of all the features on his race car
"The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
boy.

MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.

MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
accent.

CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together.  Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.

                              CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.

BUTCH
I'm ready.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him
on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH
COOLIDGE".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for
Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,
empty locker room.

TITLE CARD:

"THE GOLD WATCH"

We hear over the black and white title:

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)

bloodiest and, hands-down, the most

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
inside.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named
ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,
sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a
white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of
boxing?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundation. But it's of
paramount importance that during the
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

CLICK – Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,
HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through
the rearview mirror:

ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to
pick up?

BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the
guy you're supposed to pick up.

ESMARELDA
Where to?

BUTCH
Outta here.

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?

MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the
dinner.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table –
dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a
cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.

INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
find the roll bar.

BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back
here?

ESMARELDA
I have to do it.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?

BUTCH
(still working on the
glove)
What?

ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio – you're the fighter?

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH
(drying himself with
a gym towel)
I'm him.

ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH
He's dead?

ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.

He finished wiping himself down.

BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?

BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of
them cigarettes, I'll give you an
answer.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

ESMARELDA
Deal!

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in
it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

BUTCH
So...

He looks at her license.

BUTCH
...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that
Mexican?

ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm
Columbian.

BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got
there, sister.

ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH
Butch.

ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to
kill a man –

BUTCH
– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know
he was dead 'til you told me he was
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you
wanna know how I feel about it?

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit
bad.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you
spread it around with?

(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news – I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.

BUTCH
(to himself in French
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.

Handing her the money.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.

BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans.

He gives her the bill.

BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

FABIENNE
Keep the light off.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in
babytalk.

FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH
Uh-huh?

FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and
you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy.

BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you
do.

FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star," it's not
the same thing.

BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
belly.

FABIENNE
The difference is huge.

BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to
accentuate it.

BUTCH
You think guys would find that
attractive?

FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find
attractive. It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the
same.

BUTCH
If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
it.

FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH
Right in the belly.

FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
right on your face 'til you couldn't
breathe.

BUTCH
You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE
Yes!

BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Yes, I did.

BUTCH
Good job.

FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were
you the winner?

BUTCH
I won alright.

FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?

BUTCH
Sure am.

FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?

BUTCH
Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no
more?!

BUTCH
Not no more.

FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?

Butch nods his head: "no."

FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a
nuisance -

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

FABIENNE
Say it!

BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE
Forever?

BUTCH
...and ever.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

FABIENNE
Do you love me?

BUTCH
Oui.

FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

BUTCH
Will you kiss it?

She nods her head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But you first.

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FABIENNE
(in French, with
English subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.

                        FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
head out.

BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.

BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back!  Can I have a towel please,
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
on her head.

BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
back.

She hands him a towel.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE
Butch?

BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?

BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in
Bora Bora?

BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
el zapataria?

FABIENNE
What does that mean?

BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
my little mama ceta in no time.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?

FABIENNE
Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?

FABIENNE
What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
two, then she remember something.

FABIENNE
Butch.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

FABIENNE
Forget it.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                        FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
him.

His start startles Fabienne.

FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have
a bad dream?

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

BUTCH
What are you watching?

FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
name.

BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?

Fabienne enters the room.

FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?

BUTCH
Would you please?

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war.

FABIENNE
What was it about?

BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it.

Fabienne laughs.

FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?

BUTCH
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.

BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
don't remember.

FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
in your sleep?

BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
in my sleep?

FABIENNE
You did last night.

BUTCH
What did I say?

Laying on top of him.

FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand
you.

She kisses Butch.

FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes.

BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

FABIENNE
Satisfied?

BUTCH
Yep.

FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

BUTCH
What time is it?

FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?

BUTCH
Eleven.

FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH
(surprised at her
potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?

Butch is finished dressing.

FABIENNE
(referring to his
clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.

As he goes through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese –

BUTCH
– where's my watch?

FABIENNE
It's there.

BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE
Have you looked?

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

He's now throwing clothes.

BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

FABIENNE
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
–

BUTCH
– on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH
Well it's not here!

FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!

BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
menacing.

BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE
I believe so...

BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE
Then I did.

BUTCH
Are you sure?

FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
mind reader.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

FABIENNE
I'm sorry.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?

BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch.

FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for
you there?

BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split.

Rising from the floor.

FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE
Don't go.

BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say,
blueberry pie.

FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.

BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
Okay?  Okay?

FABIENNE
Okay.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE
Bye.

BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE
Okay.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
fists as he drives down the street.

BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. "Bedside table – on the
kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't
forget my father's watch."

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.

                              CUT TO:

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY – DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears
disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
"MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA – DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building.

INT. HONDA – DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
Butch.  They keep underestimatin'
ya.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he
SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

BUTCH
I guess.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
gather around the body.

GAWKER #1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

GAWKER #2
If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
that car.

MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?

GAWKER #2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street, looking a shambles.

MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back
away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
him.

BUTCH
Sacre bleu.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
screaming.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
Butch RACES into his world.

MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH
Shut up!

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
next to the door.

MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute
–

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
of his middle finger.

BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch
then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
shield the splatter.

BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught
me –

MAYNARD (O.S.)
– hold it right there, godammit!

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your
business –

MAYNARD
– I'm makin' it my business! Now
toss that gun!

Butch does.

MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to
the counter.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
caught a coupl'a flies.

Marsellus passes out.

                        FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are
two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and
a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are
unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in
his belt.

MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.

A BUZZER buzzes.

MAYNARD
That's Zed.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
long time, then says:

ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD
I did.

ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?

Butch makes no reply.

ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
of this place?

MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED
No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.

ZED
Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
up then, won't you?

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises
THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
then backs away.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

MAYNARD
Who's first?

ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany,
miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

ZED
Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
room.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
the ceiling.

MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.

The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
in 'em!

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Good, I like to fight!

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it... that's it boy, you're
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
that... that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
hold 'em!

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

THE GIMP
Huhng?

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched
positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden
horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,
which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

BUTCH
You okay?

MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
okay!

Long pause.

BUTCH
What now?

MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what
now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
on homes here with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
ain't through with you by a damn
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
your ass.

BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and
you?

MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
ya what now between me an' you. There
is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH
So we're cool?

MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
ask – two things I ask: Don't tell
nobody about this. This shit's between
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It
ain't nobody else's business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
when you're gone, stay gone.  You've
lost your Los Angeles privileges.
Deal?

BUTCH
Deal.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
bit of a situation.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says,
Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a
BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?

BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE
You're hurt?

BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her
hand.

BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?

FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a
little)
It was good –

BUTCH
– did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk –
are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH
It's a chopper.

FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH
Zed's.

FABIENNE
Who's Zed?

BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

                        FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!

JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men..."

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly
CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

JULES (O.S.)
"...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And
you will know I am the Lord when I
lay my vengeance upon you."

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around
is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his
hand cannon.

FOURTH MAN
Die... die... die... die...!

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion
crosses his face.

TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

FOURTH MAN
I don't understand –

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs
it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your
mind?  Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?

JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.

VINCENT
.357.

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else.

Vincent prepares to leave.

VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.

JULES
That was... divine intervention. You
know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means.
That's exactly what it means! God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

VINCENT
I think we should be going now.

JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do
that!  Don't blow this shit off!
What just happened was a fuckin'
miracle!

VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.

JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen.

VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the
jailhouse with the cops?

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my
friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge
it!

VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we
leave now?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and
Marvin in the back.

VINCENT
...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I
was watchin' it once and this cop
was on it who was talkin' about this
time he got into this gun fight with
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on
this guy and he doesn't hit anything.
And these guys were in a hallway.
It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my
eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?

JULES
That's it for me. For here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

JULES
Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules –

JULES
– I said don't do that –

VINCENT
– you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm
through.

VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell
'im why.

JULES
Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off.

JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his
grip.

VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came
down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets?

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES
blood and SHAKES.

JULES
What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT
I just accidentally shot Marvin in
the throat.

JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it
was an accident.

JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in
my time –

VINCENT
– chill out, man, it was an accident,
okay? You hit a bump or somethin'
and the gun went off.

JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'
bump!

VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went
off, don't ask me how!

JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin'
around on a city street in broad
daylight –

VINCENT
– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'
about the splatter.

JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this
car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you're driving a car
drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly
place?

JULES
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley.

VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your
town, Jules.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

VINCENT
Who ya callin'?

JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES
On the other side of the hill, by
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass
ain't home, I don't know what the
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any
other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are
in some serious shit. We're in a car
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I
need to use your garage for a couple
hours.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while
Vincent stands behind him.

JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie's situation. He's
one remark away from kickin' our
asses out the door.

VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made
a couple phone calls. But I never
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's
my friend and you don't bust in your
friend's house and start tellin' 'im
what's what.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at
the sink.

VINCENT
Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He
kinda freaked out back there when he
saw Marvin.

JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's
eight o'clock in the morning. He
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for
this shit. Don't forget who's doin'
who a favor.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta
take shit, he can stick his favor
straight up his ass.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is
stained with red.

JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?

VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.

JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,
I coulda done a better job.

JULES
I used the same soap you did and
when I dried my hands, the towel
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who
cares? But it's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation to a boil.
If he were to come in here and see
that towel like that... I'm tellin'
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie
on account of you... Look, I ain't
threatenin' you, I respect you an'
all, just don't put me in that
position.

JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no
problem. He's your friend, you handle
him.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in
his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
been satisfied with freeze-dried
Tasters Choice. You spring this
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
flavor is this?

JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.

JULES
What?

JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him –

JIMMIE
– answer to question. Did you see a
sign out in front of my house that
said, "Dead nigger storage?"

JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that
sign?

JULES
Why?

JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

JIMMIE
– I ain't through! Now don't you
understand that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage
counselor, no trial separation –
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced. The last time
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
was gonna be the last time me an'
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I
wanna help ya out Julie, I really
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife
doin' it.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'
you can say that's gonna make me
forget I love my wife. Now she's
workin' the graveyard shift at the
hospital. She'll be comin' home in
less than an hour and a half. Make
your phone calls, talk to your people,
than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna
fuck up your shit. We just need to
call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's
in my bedroom.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy
robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

MARSELLUS
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

JULES
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie
situation is. If she comes home from
a hard day's work and finds a bunch
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'
what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm
doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

JULES
I don't wanna hear about no
motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna
hear from your ass is: "you ain't
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill
them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be comin'
directly."

MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in
there, chill them niggers out and
wait for The Wolf, who should be
comin' directly.

JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS
Feel better?

JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to
say.

INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite
into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a
fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in
fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:
Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the
tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The
Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules...

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)
Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

THE WOLF
...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

HE WRITES:

"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's
about thirty minutes away. I'll be
there in ten.

He hangs up. We never see his face.

                              CUT TO:

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

                              CUT TO:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at
Jimmie.

THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your
house?

JIMMIE
Yeah.

THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE
Please do.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE
100%.

THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie...
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
that correct?

JIMMIE
Uh-huh.

THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE
She won't at that.

THE WOLF
That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,
circling it.

THE WOLF
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Yes.

THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?

JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?

JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's
cool.

THE WOLF
Positive?  Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
don't work.

JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the
three men the plan of action.

THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and
Vincent)
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?

JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe
down the upholstery – now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up.  But the
windows are a different story.  Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.  Jimmie –
lead the way, boys – get to work.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

VINCENT
(calling after him)
A "please" would be nice.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

THE WOLF
Come again?

VINCENT
I said a "please" would be nice.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say "please."I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
luck gentlemen.

JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
me.

THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he
has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
somethin' –

THE WOLF
– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

JIMMIE
You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore –

THE WOLF
– let me ask you a question, if you
don't mind?

JIMMIE
Sure.

THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?

JIMMIE
No.

THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of
bills)
I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?

JIMMIE
Oak's nice.

INT. GARAGE – MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs
of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

JULES
I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit!

VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?

JULES
Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass.

VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow.

JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS
OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
nigger's skull.

INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript
vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a
good job they've done.

THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
of this yet.

JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF
Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
clean you two.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.

THE WOLF
Strip.

VINCENT
All the way?

THE WOLF
To your bare ass.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?

THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?

VINCENT
What?

THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag.

JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away.

THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

THE WOLF
Towel 'em.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
across their bodies.

THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
we first met.

THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them.

JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me.  Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
something.

(TO JULES)
What did I say?

JULES
Don't do shit unless –

THE WOLF
– unless what?

JULES
Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
jangling?

VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his
car keys)
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

JULES
We cool?

WINSTON
Like it never happened.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.

RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,
I'd be great.  What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?

VINCENT
Redondo Beach.

JULES
Inglewood.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
"DEAD ZONE" trance.

WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Winston turns to leave.

JULES
Mr. Wolf.

He turns around.

JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

The Wolf smiles.

WINSTON
Call me Winston.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character.

RAQUEL
I have character.

WINSTON
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

JULES
Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT
You know I could go for some
breakfast.  Want to have breakfast
with me?

JULES
Sure.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
refill for both men,

VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's
nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?

JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT
Are you Jewish?

JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
on swine.

VINCENT
Why not?

JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat
filthy animals.

VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.

JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces.

VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces.

JULES
I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

The two men laugh.

VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?

JULES
The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
a freak occurrence.

JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT
An act of God.

JULES
What's an act of God?

VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
this morning qualifies.

JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved.

VINCENT
But why?

JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
to sleep.

VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really
gonna quit?

JULES
The life, most definitely.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life,
what'll you do?

JULES
That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures.

VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the
earth?

JULES
Until God puts me where he want me
to be.

VINCENT
What if he never does?

JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait
forever.

VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?

JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no
more, no less.

VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

JULES
Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ –

VINCENT
– what happened was peculiar – no
doubt about it – but it wasn't water
into wine.

JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
scary questions.

VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?!

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
out, COCKING IT.

PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on
the floor.

HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
terrified.

PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
here!  Asta luego!

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all –

Pumpkin heads his way.

PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
Manager's neck.

PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me
a problem?

MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
any problem!

PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
anything you want.

PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
be all over.

MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
soon!

PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
on the ground.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.

PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
respectful, him manner more on guard.

PUMPKIN
In the bag.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

PUMPKIN
What's in that?

JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES
When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.

JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
thing.

PUMPKIN
Open it up.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
hammer.

PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.

JULES
Yes, you did.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.

HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last.

MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here.

JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
business!

PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Clear? One...

PUMPKIN
...two... three.

JULES
You win.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN
Open it.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
the room, can't see shit.

HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?

Jules nods his head: "yes."

PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.

Jules nods his head: "yes."

HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!

JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.

JULES
Promise her.

PUMPKIN
I promise.

JULES
Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN
Just chill out.

JULES
What's her name?

PUMPKIN
Yolanda.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
at Pumpkin.

JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.

JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
what' Fonzie like?

No answer.

JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?

JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

Pumpkin looks at him.

JULES
One... two... three.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!

JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool.  When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous.  When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
Yolanda.

JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
cool.

VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT
Check.

JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I.  It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet.

PUMPKIN
Which one is it?

JULES
It's the one that says Bad
Motherfucker on it.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet
with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
much is there?

PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score.

VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle.

JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN
What?

JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
read the Bible?

PUMPKIN
Not regularly.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you." I been sayin' that shit for
years.  And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
takes a sip of coffee.

JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.

JULES
That's probably a good idea.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
– wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts,
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word.

                             FADE OUT

   THE END






And so?


And so,
I'm sitting there staring at him, right?


He tells me to get my crunchy
fucking fucknuts the fuck out of there.


You believe that shit?


You know what I said, right?
- No, what did you say?


Shit.'Okay.'
- You fucking said, 'Okay.'


I'm sure you did.


Control Center,
this is Stillwell 1215.


Go ahead, Stillwell 1215.


I'm about four cars
out of 57th Street station...


...being delayed by a red signal light.


Should be green, Stillwell 1215.


Yeah, tell me something
I don't already know.


All right, roll through it slow,
extreme caution, per the rulebook.


Yeah, cracked rail. Nine-hundred feet
from the east end of the platform.


It's the goddamn cold.
Metal contracts, you know that.


I got it, I got it.
How long it take to fix it?


Gotta put a plate on it. Two hours.


Thank you. Make it an hour and a half,
I'll buy you a beer.


Shit, G.B. I hate to see you
down here on the floor, man.


Temporary, baby. I'll be up there
behind the glass before you know it.


I'm gonna need the R train...


...to switch over
to the express tracks at 34th.


Which express tracks?
- The one that Q uses.


Once they exit the 57th Street,
they can switch over to the F Line.


Straight into Queens.


Once they get to Queens, they switch
back at 36th Street to the R Line.


All you gotta do, suspend the W,
N and R will pick up the slack.


I can't see where I gotta look.


Unlock the door.
Do it now or I'll kill you. Do it.


All right, all right.


Shut up and walk.


First car, go.


See? I told you I could do this.


Big fucking deal,
you did what you said you'd do.


All right.


Five minutes of peace.


Yeah.
- Nice.


Nice.
- All right.


There you go.


I'm on the train and I still got you.


You still got me?
- I got you. What are you doing?


You still got me?


Oh, my God.


Baby? Baby?


Give me the cutting key.


Cutting key.


Control Center calling Pelham 123.
Come in, Pelham 123.


Why did you stop?
You're all green ahead.


Control Center calling Pelham 123.


Control Center calling Pelham 123.


Why did you stop, 123?
You got green ahead.


It's okay.


Life is simple now.


You just gotta do what I say.


Not now, okay?


Where are you from?


Brooklyn.
- You lrish?


Yeah.


I thought so.


Who's driving Pelham 123?


Maybe something fell on the tracks.


Wait. Are we going backwards?


42nd Street tower,
I got a train wrong-railing...


...on the southbound Lexington
Avenue Line just north of you.


Listen up,
we need to stop and stay in-station.


All southbound locals
just north of the 51st Street station.


The operator on 123 is Jerry Pollard.


I know Jerry Pollard.
I went to motorman school with Jerry.


Pelham 123,
come in to me, Pelham 123.


Pelham 123, Jerry Pollard,
what's going on down there?


This is Control Center.
What's going on, 123?


Get an express train to go alongside
them, see what we see in the cab.


Yeah, this is South Ferry 105. I can't
get my windshield wiper to turn on.


South Ferry 105, there's a circuit
breaker right behind you for that.


What's going on?


Maestro, what's going on?


Cop.
- Excuse me.


Fuck.
- Watch your backs. Watch your backs.


When I say stop, stop it hard.


Transit Police.
- Stop.


Everybody sit the fuck down.


Down.


Sit the fuck down.


Jesus. We're getting reports
of gunshots down the tunnel.


Sergeant Moran.


Delgado, let's call off that express.
- Got it.


I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna fucking die, man.


Come on. Hey.


Everybody up. By the window.
Come on, up, up, up.


Stand up. Stand up. Come on.


Move it. Against the window.


What the fuck is going on?


There was a cop. Bashkin shot him.


I think-- I think he's dead.


Put Bashkin on and find your fucking guts.


Do it.
- Fuck.


What happened?
- A cop. He's dead.


Put the conductor on.


What's your name, conductor?
- Regina.


Regina, baby, listen,
you got a job to do, honey.


A job?


God put you on this Earth
for one thing and one thing only.


You conduct those people off the train...


...up to the platform.
You got that? Let me hear it.


Let me hear you do that.


Listen up, everybody.


We're gonna go back to the platform.
I need everybody to--


Regina. Let's do it again.


Conduct those people.


Listen. Now, we're gonna head back
towards the platform.


I want everybody to slowly get up.


I'm gonna get you off this train.
- Good.


Now, we're gonna be on the tracks,
so if you don't need it, leave it.


Have been put on alert regarding--


Right here, right here.
Right here, right here.


Cross right here, right here.


Go.
- Cross over right here, right here.


Let's go.


Up the stairs, up the stairs.
- Here you go.


Every cop in the city is on the way.
- Maybe it wasn't gunshots.


Train could be blowing breakers.
Or the motor blew?


No, this is on purpose.


Fuck you.


Yeah, I'm coming.
- Get the fuck off the walls.


Shut the fuck up and come on.


Shit. Come on.


Ramos.
Turn the power off from there down.


What?


Turn the power off from there down.


Okay, I got it.


My fucking lucky day.


Shit.
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?


Pelham 123 to Rail Control Center.
Do you read me?


Yes, I read you, Pelham 123.


This is Control Center. Who is this?


It's me, man. I didn't wanna call
till everything was ready.


It's not Jerry.
- I don't know who it is.


I understand, I understand,
Pelham 123.


Who the hell is this?


This is the man who's gonna rock this city.


This is the man who's gonna
give the city a run for the money.


Look up. Look up at your screen
and you tell me what you see.


You see what I've done?


I see it.


One car is much more manageable
than 10 with the manpower I got.


Motorman's gonna tell you
about it. Tell him what we got.


They got hostages, lots of them.


And they got machine guns.
- That's Jerry.


That's Jerry.
- Yeah, that's right.


Check me,
do you understand that?


I check, I understand.


Didn't I tell you to knock first?


Good, because this is what we call
a cash transaction.


Now, you understand commodities,
don't you?


You know, pork bellies?
Gold? Light crude?


Listen, no disrespect, but maybe I'm
not the guy you should be talking to.


Oh, no, you are exactly the guy
I wanna talk to.


Now, I want you to look at the ticker
and you tell me...


...what is the going rate
for a New York City hostage today?


You think a million dollars
is too much? I do. I think it's corny.


Now get your calculator out.
You got one?


Do you have a calculator?
- Yeah, we got one. I got one.


Okay, good. Add this up.
You got $526,315 and 79 cents.


That's 526,315.79.


Now, times that by 19.


What do you got?


What is he, a goddamn accountant?


That's 10 million?
- What do you got?


That comes out to 10 million plus one cent.


That is a deal.


You call the mayor
and you tell him the price.


And then you tell him I want it in
100,000 $100 bills, you got that?


I got it. What about the one cent?


Keep that, that's your broker fee.


Now, I want the rest in plain suitcases...


...the kind with the wheels
and the portable handle, okay?


Now, this is not a futures contract.
This is a spot trade.


That means there's a time limit on it.
Okay, you got that?


Now, what do you think is a fair time limit?


You know, I don't know.
I'm really just a guy--


Come on, give me a time limit.
Give me a fair time limit.


Thursday.
- I was thinking more like an hour.


Now, what's your watch say?


Two-thirteen.


Oh,
that's exactly what my watch says.


So at 3:13, I want that money here,
motherfucker.


And after that, there is a late fee.


What do you think
that late fee is gonna be?


Come on, tell me what it'll be.


You're gonna kill the passengers?


Oh, commodities is what I start to kill.


One for every minute
past the deadline I am forced to wait.


They become more valuable this way...


...and still at the same price.


He's underground.
He's never gonna pull this off.


Don't tell me, tell him.
- Who the hell is this guy?


I don't know who it is.
- Garber, just stay with it.


What's your name?


What's your name, my man?
- My name?


What's your name?


Tell him?


Garber.
- Garber, okay.


Now, seriously, man,
in 59 minutes...


...I'm gonna start killing passengers.


So my advice to you is to get on
the phone, get the mayor notified now.


Listen, I mean....


I'm just a civil-service employee.
I can't get ahold of the mayor.


That's your problem, not mine.


It's like, who's responsible for
who lives and who dies in New York?


That's New York City's problem.


Get the fuck off the radio
and notify the mayor, motherfucker.


Okay.


Nine months of this and I'm free.
Next mayor gets inaugurated...


...I'm gonna be in Saint-Tropez
on the beach with a pina colada.


I will never have to ride the subway
ever again.


Never say never, sir.
- Never.


All right,
what's next for the afternoon?


East Harlem Elementary at 2:30.


You're to read
The Cat In The Hat to the third grade.


Every time I go to the schools,
I get sick. They all have runny noses.


Call Dr. Katz, tell him I want him
waiting at the school, with a flu shot.


Mayor's office.


He's in Car 3.
- Yeah.


What happened?


Somebody just hijacked a 6 train.


It's stopped in the tunnel
between 51st and 42nd.


Another idiot with a gun.
What do we know?


It's unclear, but I have a car
waiting for us downstairs.


Subway will get us there faster.


All right. Let the doors close.


Tell them we'll meet them at 59th Street.


Tell the conductor this is now an express.


We're skipping the next five stops.
- What?


I gotta get to work.
- Hold on, hold on.


Everybody will get where they
need to go, we'll make all the stops.


Maybe he's not such a douchebag
after all, huh?


Funny.


Figures you'd be the one
to get a call like this.


Hostage negotiation team here in five
minutes and the mayor's been notified.


You gonna tell him?
- Get the fuck out of here.


My shift's over in 10 minutes.


What are you staring at?
- Your face.


I'm trying to remember
for when it's not here.


You gonna start in on me?
- Right, I'm gonna start in on you.


Don't fuck this up, Garber.
- You wanna do it?


It's your station, your call.


Oh, it's my call now?
- That's right. Your call.


Come on.


Pelham 123, come in, this is
Rail Control Center. Are you there?


Gerber Baby boy. What's up?


Garber. Just wanted to let you know
the mayor's been notified.


Are they gonna pay?


I don't know. I'm just the,
what'd you call me? The broker.


No, no, you represent
the city of New York right now, buddy.


I can tell you you're dealing with one
of the all-time bureaucracies, I know.


I mean, it takes time.
- You'd better fix the bureaucracy...


...because when the time comes,
these hostages...


...are gonna go real quick.


You got it, you got it.
Any other demands?


Yeah,
no fucking pizza for them, either.


No, I mean, are you guys, like,
you know, are you terrorists?


Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?


Actually, you don't, but I mean,
not that I ever talked to one.


So--


So, what, this is just about money?


Oh, is there anything else?


There's not dying.


Yeah, well, you live, you die. You
go with the current or you fight it...


...you all end up in the same place.


Where's that, Jersey?
- Yeah, you watch it. I was born there.


I'm just saying,
you're up in the motorman's cab.


That means you're on the radio, which
means that you're an easy target.


You gotta know the drill.


I know that soon I won't be alone...


...and if I'm the first to get shot,
I'm the first of many to get shot.


That's correct,
but then you'd still be dead.


Dead is an improvement on a lot
of things I can think of, buddy boy.


Sounds like he slept with my ex.


You know, we all owe God a death.


And I'm a man who pays his debts.
Are you a man who pays his debts?


Yeah, yeah, sure.
TV, cable, and my mortgage.


That's a little like dying once a month.
- You're married, you're a married man.


Maybe.


No, no, no. You're married, man.
Married men have mortgages.


You got a mortgage?


I don't know. Why don't you tell me,
then we'll both know?


I don't know. I'm sure someone
out there loves you dearly and...


...you know,
would be worried about you.


You're in the motorman's cab...


...you got no cover,
sniper on the way.


Well, you know,
circumstances are my protection...


...because right now, you know,
hostages are good insurance.


By the way I see it,
I'm pretty well-protected.


You know, this reminds me
of being in a confessional.


Are you Catholic?


I'm married, you're Catholic.


Maybe. I don't know.
- No, you're Catholic.


And a good Catholic...


...would know he's got
a trainload of innocent people.


You don't wanna
kill innocent people, do you?


A good Catholic
knows that nobody is innocent.


And I'm not gonna kill all these
hostages. I'd give up my leverage.


Well,
I hope you know what you're doing.


It's running like a fucking Swiss watch
down here, so don't worry about it.


So, what do I call you anyway?


Call me Ryder.


As in 'train rider'?


Call me Ryder, with a Y.


Ryder.


I like you, Garber.


I do like you, man.


You may be the last friend I ever make.


Well, I hope you're wrong, Mr. Ryder.
But, you know, I'm just a guy.


I'm just a guy on the other end of the mic.


Oh, you don't think this was meant to be?


You don't think this was fate,
you and me?


I don't know. Things happen
that lead to other things.


And maybe this was one of them,
but that's it.


I never get excited about coincidence.


Well, you got 50 fucking minutes,
so check me.


All right. 50 minutes, check.


And don't call me unless you got news.


You got it.
- Motherfucker.


G.B.


You're fucking good, man.


Okay. Move it the other way.


All right, come on, move it.
The other way.


Okay, now move it back a little less.


Bingo. Got it.


All right, we got it.


Who's talked to these jokers?
- That would be me.


Yeah, under my supervision.
Who are you?


Vincent Camonetti,
NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team.


John Johnson,
Chief Transportation Officer.


Walter Garber.
I'm Console Dispatch, right now.


What can you tell me, Walter?


His name is Ryder, with a Y.


And he's asking for $10 million by 3:13.


Looking toward the future. Say what
he'd do if he doesn't get the money?


He said he'd kill a passenger
every minute we go over.


Starting at 3:13 p.m.?
- 3-1-3, yes, sir.


Anything else?
- He's smart.


If he's smart, why is he doing
something so fucking stupid?


On the train radio?
- We can get him right here.


Any chance that we can get
a signal down there?


We'd like to get him on one of our cells.


No,
there's no chance, not where he is.


What's this?
'Leverage, spot trade'?


Yeah, it's weird. He's like
a money guy, like a Wall Street.


He talked about the passengers
like they were commodities.


'Catholic'?
- Yeah, I think he's Catholic.


For chrissakes, Garber, you gonna tell
us what his zodiac sign is now?


I'm just saying I think he's Catholic.


Man asked me about 'Catholic.'
I wrote it down. I'm giving my opinion.


Unlike other people,
I have an opinion.


Fellas, can we settle this dispute later?


Absolutely.
- Why do you think he's Catholic?


I think he's Catholic because he talked
about original sin and confessions.


I wrote it down.
I didn't know what else to do.


Did he ask for a priest?
- No.


Good. Anything else?


He sounded, the way he was talking,
he sounded like he's not afraid to die.


Yeah, well, it's early yet.


The calls are coming through...?
- Right here.


You hit the blue button,
you can reach him.


He'll come back to you.
- Mind if I take your seat?


No, no, go right ahead.
- Thank you, Walter.


You're welcome.


This is the six wire.
You don't have to touch that one.


Okay.
- That goes around the room.


Six wire.
- Why don't you--


Just hit the talk here and then that mutes it.


Take the rest of the day off.
Get out of here.


I thought I'd stick around,
just make sure that....


Well, that wasn't a suggestion.
So why don't you go home?


All right.


This is it. You got all the information
over here about the 313.


Wait for his call.
- You want me to work it up right now?


You call headquarters, let them know
that I'm here and I'm on the job. Okay.


I gotta take a piss.


So who's stopping you?


All right. We wouldn't wanna end up
on any Amnesty lnternational lists...


...so step up to the door, face out.


Open the middle door.


Do what you gotta do.


Can I jump down there?


You gotta go or don't you?
- I do, I gotta go.


Step up, my man. Let's go, let's go.


That kid's going places.
All right, close the doors.


Pelham 123, come in.


Pelham 123, please come in.
- All right, everybody, sit down.


Who is this?


This is Lieutenant Camonetti. I'm with
the NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team.


I'd like to talk to you
about the situation that we're in.


Where the fuck is Garber?


Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher.


This is now a police matter.
- Yeah, well, I wanna talk to Garber.


I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder,
but Mr. Garber is no longer involved.


Motorman, up.


Put Garber on.
- To be honest...


...Mr. Garber has gone home.


Put Garber on the fucking line
or I kill the motorman.


I guarantee you I am the best person
for you to be talking to right now.


Give me a moment and I'll explain why.


You were always
gonna be the first one to go.


Oh, Jesus.


Jesus.


Mr. Camonetti...


...you got 60 fucking seconds
before I kill another.


Okay? Fifty-nine, 58, 57....
- Get him. Just get Garber.


Fifty-six, 55, 54....
- We're trying to locate Garber...


...ASAP, Mr. Ryder.
Why did you do that?


Mr. Camonetti or whatever
fucking greaseball name you got...


...the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?


Fifty-three, 52, 51....


Garber. Garber.


Garber, he killed Jerry Pollard, man.


Come on,
he wants to talk to you right now.


He's here. He's on the way.


Eleven, 10, nine, eight, seven....


He's approaching the desk.
- Six, five, four, three, two, one....


Hey, it's me, it's Garber.


Garber. You didn't say goodbye.


You killed Jerry?


No, the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?


The biggest rathole
in the world fucking killed Jerry.


Okay? Now you can
chalk another victim up to NYC.


Now, can everybody hear me?
- Yeah, we hear you, loud and clear.


Now you don't have to tell the cops...


...they don't tell me how to do it or how
it's gonna be. I fucking tell them.


Don't you ever, ever leave me again.


Or I'll just have to hunt you down
and I'll kill you.


Now, you got 39--


Thirty-nine minutes. Check me.


Thirty-nine, check.


This is Staley to ESU 2.
What's your position?


ESU 2 approaching hostage car
from south tunnel.


Go, go, go.


Ten-million dollars. I'll write him
a check and get it over with.


He wants it in cash.
- I was joking, LaSalle.


But we've been given one hour
to get the money together.


Ten-million dollars.
Where do they get these numbers?


Actually, 10 is the limit, sir.


Why is that?


Request to the City Controller,
he forwards it to one of our lenders...


...cash gets released to the Federal
Reserve. Limit at any time is 10 million.


Some idiot with a gun
wouldn't know that. I didn't know.


Well, you're very busy, sir.
- How do you know that?


Here he is.


Henry, what's the situation?
- They killed a hostage.


These guys may be the real deal.


I thought there was one idiot with a gun.


Multiple gunmen. They're not sure.
They've got 18 hostages.


They'll kill more in an hour. That's
the limit. They want you to know.


What do we know?
- Not amateurs.


They cut out a car,
stopped on a rise.


They can see us coming
100 yards either way.


How long to get the money?


I don't know.
- Find out.


You're not thinking of paying, are you?
- I'm thinking of time and being ready.


Call the Controller.
Tell them we'll pay.


What's with you and Garber, huh?
Tell me about him.


Scheduled to work today?


Yeah, absolutely. But....
- But what?


He's only had this particular job
for a couple weeks now.


Well, why is that?
- Well, he's under investigation.


What?


We were gonna suspend him--
- What's he being investigated for?


He went to Japan. He had to take
a look at some new trains...


...and the allegation is that he took a bribe.


Took a bribe?
Does he have a record?


Not that I know.
- You sure?


Yeah, yeah. I don't think so.
I gotta take this.


The identity of the hijackers is still unclear.


The Hostage Negotiation Team has
just arrived at MTA headquarters...


...to determine
if this is a terrorist enterprise.


Is that what we are? An enterprise?


We're an enterprise.


Well, pilot reports
that the aircraft has begun its descent.


This is Staley to ESU 4.
What's your ETA?


Approximately two minutes south of target.


Why is the train called Pelham 123?


Comes out of Pelham Bay
at 1:23 in the afternoon.


How did you end up with this call?


It's a Lexington Avenue train.


I got the Lexington Avenue desk.
Came through my desk.


Can you think of a reason
why you'd be targeted?


Someone wanna hurt you?
Something against you or something?


No.


You recognize his voice?


No. No, as I said, it was a coincidence
it came through my desk.


Did you pick this desk?
Or was it assigned to you?


Did l...?


I said, did you pick this desk
or was it assigned to you?


Can I take my coat off?


Doesn't make any sense.


What doesn't?
- Guy you're talking to.


He ain't a train dispatcher.
Walter Garber.


He's a big shot.
- Big shot at what?


Rail Control.
I mean, he runs things up there.


At least he did before I went up.
- His name is Walter?


Yeah.


Dude like that
shouldn't be answering the phone.


Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you.
- Right.


Are you sure you don't have
some sort of relationship with him?


I assure you, whatever relationship
I have with him is better than yours.


Jerry, my friend, was killed
while you were talking to Ryder.


Maybe that's a question
you ask yourself instead of me.


I didn't have anything to do with this.


But what I have in you,
Mr. Garber, is an unknown variable.


Unknown variable?
- Right. People's lives are at stake.


I understand that.
- Excuse me...


...if I try to get more comfortable
with you, okay?


It ain't working, but okay.


Now, with that in mind...


...would you agree
to a consensual search of your house?


Take me 40, 45 minutes to get a warrant.


What....


Yes, okay.


Got him.


Walter Garber, right there.


No shit, look at this.


Guy took a bribe, man.
- Yeah.


Baby.


ESU 2, this is Staley.
What's your overall status?


All positions secured.


All right,
hold your fire until instructed.


Pelham 123, can you hear me?


Yeah, loud and clear, back at you.


All right,
the mayor has agreed to pay...


...and they're getting the money
together right now.


Good.


Well, you know, you got 28 minutes,
so I advise him to make haste.


I'm sure he will.
- So is your first name Walter?


Excuse me?
- Your name, is it Walter?


Yes, it is.
- Good.


What are you doing dispatching trains?


I thought you were some sort of
MTA big shot.


I work for the MTA.
Today they put me at dispatch...


...and my bad luck.


I thought you didn't believe in bad luck.


I said I didn't believe in fate.


Do you believe in
rigged contracts for new trains?


Look, what are we talking about this for?


I need to know who I'm dealing with.
- You need to know who--?


Yeah, I want to know who I'm dealing
with. I mean, are you a bad penny?


Let me explain something to you.


Being accused of something is one thing.


Being guilty of it
is something entirely different.


Well, agreed. But you gotta
take me through this, my man.


You got to tell me from the top.
This whole train thing. Come on.


All right,
I started out in maintenance.


Platform maintenance,
track maintenance, flagman...


...conductor.
- Conductor, really?


Yeah. And then motorman.


A motorman.
How long did you do that for?


I drove them over six years.


I went to tower operations,
assistant dispatcher, dispatcher.


I finally ended up--


Yeah, you're assistant chief
transportation officer or something.


Right?
- That's right.


And part of my job is to go out
to the manufacturers, you know...


...the people who build the trains
and bid on contracts for the trains.


Is that where you took the bribe?


The Japanese train
over the Canadian train?


I did not take a bribe, all right?
I was accused of taking a bribe.


I have not been proven guilty yet.


They haven't said yet.
I mean, they haven't decided.


Well, they got no proof. I don't care
what they decide. It doesn't matter--


Then is this when they demoted you?


That's correct. They demoted me,
pending the outcome.


And now they're trying
to humiliate you, is that right?


Motherfuckers.


Look, I know
how these things work, man, okay?


Everything doesn't seem
to appear like what it is.


But you've gotta be
completely honest with me, man.


Don't know what you're talking about.
- How did you do it?


I didn't. I'm innocent.


Oh, you're innocent.


No, you're talking to a Catholic,
man.


We've been over innocent before.
Okay?


Look, I've been through all this, man.
So just tell me, how did you do it?


I didn't do it.


Okay, that's it. That's fucking it.


Damn it.


Kid. You.
- Me?


No, no, you. Up.
Get the fuck over there.


I don't know what you did to piss him off.


Garber.
You know what I'm looking at?


Do you know what I'm looking at?
- No, I do not.


First there's my gun, and at the end
of my gun-- What's your name?


George. Everyone calls me Geo.
- George. His friends call him Geo.


Got this '80s skateboard thing going.


He makes it work, but it's not gonna
look too good in his casket.


Listen, Ryder, just slow down.
We haven't reached the deadline.


No, there's no fucking deadline,
man.


You just gotta tell me the truth.


About what?
- The bribe.


Did you take it?
- I didn't take a bribe.


Okay, you got five seconds
to save this kid's life.


I didn't do anything.


Five....
- Just wait a second.


Four, three....
- Wait a second.


Two....


Fucking tell him how you did it.
- All right, okay.


Say it.
- I took the bribe.


How much?


Thirty....


How fucking much?


Thirty-five thousand dollars.


How did you do it?


I went to Japan to look at these trains.


It's part of my job.


I....


I don't get to vote, okay?
I just recommend.


I chose what I thought was the best train...


...the Japanese had the best train,
and I made my recommendation.


That's before you took the bribe.


Yes.


That was the train
you were gonna pick anyway, huh?


Yes.
- And now you're fighting for your job...


...and they're trying to humiliate you?


No, no, no. I did what I did.


And....


And it's not, you know,
it's not the MTA's fault.


What did you spend it on?


Look, what does this
got to do with anything, huh?


What did you fucking spend it on?


I used the money for my kids,
all right?


To pay my children's tuition.


I have a 17-year-old.
I have a 19-year-old daughter.


And I used the money to pay
for their college tuition, all right?


You know what, Garber?


You're my goddamn hero,
you know that?


You got a kid here, you don't even
know him, you saved his life.


That's brave, man.
That's fucking heroic.


Tell Garber thank you.
- Thank you, Garber.


'Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life.'


Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life.


You're welcome.


Sit down.


You're just like me, Garber.
I fueled this city.


I fed it breakfast every morning,
and now we're the bad guys.


I don't think so.
I don't fucking think so.


Hello, Therese.
- Honey, look.


There are police here, Walt.
They wanna search the house.


They said you said it was okay.


Yeah. Yeah, it's okay.
It's-- Just let them in.


We got nothing to hide.


Is this about the investigation?


No, no. You watching TV?


This hostage thing.
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching it.


Well, it's just that....


I'll tell you about it when I get home...


...but I'm in the middle of it now and
they wanna do background checks...


...on everybody involved here
from the MTA.


That's why they're at the house.
- All right, okay. But you're okay?


I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let them in.
I'll see you when I get home.


All right. Okay, bye.


I'm sorry, Walter.


I am.


Listen, don't let this guy
bring you into his reality, all right?


That's what he wants to do.
He hurts you, you get angry.


He's got the advantage. Understand?
- Yeah.


Just deflect, if you can.


Okay? All right.
- All right.


I hope they don't get fucking lost.


Fuck me. Ten-million bucks.


The joke is,
say we dipped in, took some?


Bad guys would count it,
come up short, probably kill us.


No shit.


Geo, what the fuck's happening?


Geo. Geo, what's going on?


Geo.


I'm a fucking hostage.


Listen to me.
Stream it on our site. Call the news.


Shit.


Hey.


We've gotta do something.
They're gonna kill us.


You got a plan?


I thought you'd have one.


Because I'm some
tough-looking black guy?


I saw that ring on your finger.


That was a long time ago.


Okay?
- My husband had one just like it.


A severe sell-off underway...


...the Dow is down 450 points
in very heavy trading...


...as Wall Street reacts
to the terrorist attack...


...of the New York City subway system.


How's my hair look?
- Fine. You ready to make a statement?


When I have something to tell them.


It's a leadership moment, sir.


I'm not running for re-election,
for fucking president.


I left my Rudy Giuliani suit at home.


You're being selfish.
It'll take 30 seconds to reassure them.


Over there.
- Mr. Mayor.


Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor.
- Will you be making a statement?


We're doing everything
the situation demands.


I'm not gonna speculate right now.
All right?


Mayor, is it terrorism?
- No.


Hey.


Mayor. Are they terrorists?


All right, all right, all right.


Listen, nobody said anything
about terrorism...


...or a bomb, anything like that.
Let's stop that right now, all right?


How about your divorce? Care
to speculate how that's going?


Your divorce, sir.


Been a lot of talk in the news lately...


...that you have extramarital problems.
Your divorce, sir.


Put it on channel 15.


We got a girl in Brooklyn watching it
on her boyfriend's computer.


It's on the damn lnternet.
- What?


Hold on.


Son of a bitch.
- That's Ramos, isn't it?


That's Phil Ramos.


Yes, it is.
- Who's Phil Ramos?


He was a motorman. He killed a
couple of passengers 10 years ago?


High on cough syrup, ran into the
platform, went to jail for manslaughter.


Phil Ramos, I want everything.


Prison time, known associates, the
works. Looks like it's from the floor.


Should the lnternet be working there?
- No. No way.


Maybe that's how he knows about you.
He Googled you.


Or maybe Ramos told him,
who knows?


Goddamn, it's the mayor.
Hello, Your Honor.


Do me a favor,
forget about those guys.


Easy for you to say.


You rather be one of those hostages?


No.


Listen up, I'll give you a crash course
on hostage negotiating.


We're like rodeo clowns.


We keep the bull from focusing on
what he'd like to do. Which is what?


Kill a cowboy.
- Exactly.


Now, he's got his deadline.
You slow things down.


Preservation of life. That's our mission.
Guy's already proven he's serious.


Next deadline's gonna give a chance again.


How do we deal with that?
- Get the money there on time.


If we don't, we pretend
the deadline doesn't exist...


...talk through it, we buy time,
get movement.


Movement?
- That's right.


Contradicts himself, inconsistency in
his demand, you got some movement.


Right.
- All right, let's go out there.


This was the scene moments ago...


...outside the Rail Control Center
in Midtown.


I'm not gonna speculate right now.


That is a beautiful suit he's got there.


Can't get it out of my head.
I'm gonna die today.


Visualization's a very powerful thing.
You keep thinking it, you never know.


Please let it be me
who drops this motherfucker.


Hey, Garber. You there, buddy?


Yeah, I'm here.


A little birdie told me the mayor walked in.


Can I talk to him?


Can he hear me?
- How does he know I'm here?


Does he have a camera in here?
- Can he hear me?


We can, we can, we can--
We can all hear you here. Yes.


Okay, good. So tell him--
Tell him I wanna make him a deal.


Tell him I'll make him a deal right now.


Okay, all right.


Well, come on, speak up,
Mr. Mayor.


You're talking to your constituents.


We got a train full
of registered voters. Don't you care?


Don't you care about your voters?


This is not a good idea.
Don't talk. Don't engage with him.


I know what I'm doing,
I've been doing this a long time.


Come on, buddy, speak up.


You gotta hit the blue button there,
Your Honor.


Yes, this is the mayor.


Hey. Good to meet you, man.


And listen, tell me this, is this true?


I read that you make, like...


...one dollar a year to be a mayor
of New York, is that true?


Yes, but at least it's honest work.


After taxes that's, like,
87 cents, isn't it?


Yes.


Don't bullshit me, man.


It would take, like, 3000 years
to pay off that suit that you're wearing.


What do you got, 20, 30 million
dollars or something like that?


You don't get that without screwing
someone, screwing everyone.


I'm sure your wife knows
something about that.


You said you had a deal for me.


Yeah, I do.
I wanna make you a deal.


I wanna tell you
you could come down here...


...and I will trade you for all these
passengers in the train, how's that?


Okay, you could save the lives
of 17 New Yorkers.


Now, that's a good deal.


What do you think?


Give us a moment.


Okay.


I'll give you a moment.


You turn this into a circus,
gonna get someone killed.


Now, you entered his world, exit it.


Okay, time's up. What's the deal?


It's a nice offer, but I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to decline.


Good. Because if you begged me,
I wouldn't give you that deal, man.


You think anyone cares about
a philandering asshole like you?


New York would love me to
pull the fucking trigger on you.


Hey, Garber. This is the-- This is
the guy that's trying to get rid of you.


Keep talking.
- Do you believe this shit?


Calm--
- You don't think he...


...broke the same rules we broke?


He knows it, I know it.
- Calm him down.


All right--
- He can eat shit.


Calm him down.
- You're--...


You're breaking up.
- He can kiss my ass.


I like the deal.
It's a good deal, but--


Fuck you, Mr. Mayor.


Now, I want my fucking money now.
You understand me? Now.


Just tell him the money's on the way.
- The money's on the way.


Because he's, like,
a used-car salesman, this asshole.


He can lick my bunghole,
motherfucker.


One mistake
and everyone has something to say.


Was she worth it?


Yes. You have nine minutes.
How are you gonna get the money?


They're shutting down every
intersection here to Brooklyn.


Phil Ramos, male, Hispanic, 39.


Sentenced two to four years
for manslaughter...


...paroled last month from Clinton.


His PO, Justafarro, says he's
living in a halfway house in Queens.


He's not an absconder, he made his
appearances, his piss has been clean.


But he was a no-show at work today.
He didn't call in, nothing.


He knows the system.


The perfect place in the subway
to stop the train.


He's been out a month.
This wasn't planned in three weeks.


Find out Ramos's cellmates,
who worked in the laundry with him.


Call lists, visitors lists ASAP.


105 North Avenue.


Shit. Look out.
- Shit.


The market has tumbled nearly 7 percent...


...as investors continue to react to events....


They just came off the bridge.


Why didn't we send
a helicopter for the money?


Now remember what I said
about talking through deadlines.


We better have a plan B in case
the money isn't there on the dot.


Put him on his heels.
He knows things.


We know things too, right?
- Right.


Ask him about Phil Ramos. All right?
Just get him talking.


You can do it.


Hey, Ryder.
- The money here yet?


On the way.


Then what the fuck are you calling me for?


Actually, I just called to talk.


Oh, yeah?
What do you wanna talk about?


You said that
being in the motorman's cab...


...was a little like
being in a confessional, right?


Yeah?


I was thinking maybe it's like
being in a prison cell too.


What are you trying to say? That
if I get caught, I'd better get used to it?


No, I'm just wondering.
Maybe you're already used to it.


I'm wondering maybe that's how
you meet a guy like Phil Ramos?


How the fuck he know that?


Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.


After today's confession...


...you're gonna find your ass in prison too.


Which is my point. I want you
to hook me up on the inside.


You know everybody. This way,
when I come up with my heist plan...


...you know, I'll cut you in.


I can see I've inspired you.
Okay, I got a story for you.


It might help you in prison.
You wanna hear it? We got a minute.


I'd like to hear a little story.


So back in the day,
when I was a high roller....


When were you ever a high roller?


I told you I fed this city breakfast.


Grits and eggs?


Something like that.
Anyway, back in the day...


...I took this chick to lceland.


Iceland? Is that where
all the high rollers go?


Six hours from Kennedy
and the nightclub scene is...


...you know, is intense.


I thought I'd take this chick to lceland.


What's her name?
- Ludvika.


She was Lithuanian.
She was an ass model.


She asked you what?


You heard of hand models?


Advertisement?
Right, she was an ass model.


She did jeans and, you know,
magazines and shit.


Anyway,
it was Fashion Week in New York...


...and I took her to lceland.


Ludvika, Lithuanian, ass model,
lceland, you took her to the ice.


So what?
- Well, for 500 bucks...


...they'll take you on a dogsled ride
on a glacier.


Dogsled?
- Yeah. And you know the old saying;


If you're not the lead dog...


...the view never changes?
- Right.


Otherwise, you're always looking at
the asshole of the dog in front of you.


Be funny in a minute when I get to that part.


It's funny now.


And it's 8 in the morning,
we haven't been to bed yet...


...and we're tooling across this glacier...


...and I got this hangover that's
creeping up the back of my neck...


...and guess what I'm looking at?


Obviously you're staring at the ass
of the dog in front of you.


You got it.


So this dog, out of nowhere,
just lifts its hind legs up...


...and puts them in the harness there...


...and just takes a shit
while he's running on his front paws.


So he's dumping
and running all at the same time.


Now, that's multi-fucking-tasking
if you ask me.


Get out of here. Did it hit you?


Shit always hits you, man.


I didn't know it at the time,
but it was profound.


Profound? You lost me.
- Yeah.


Well, you know, when I went to
prison later on, which you called...


...I had trouble going to the toilet.


You know, a privacy thing.


And I couldn't take a shit.
I was scared shitless, literally.


So you know what I thought of?


You thought of the dog.
- That's right.


I thought if that dog could do
what it needed to do, so could l.


Saved my fucking life.


Wow, that is profound.


Keep going.


And, you know, it's--


People adapt. It's like you and l,
like today.


We didn't know how it was gonna start.


Wrong.
- Wrong what?


I knew exactly how it was gonna start.


Yeah, but do you know how it's gonna end?


I'm tired of talking to you, Garber.
- Wait a minute.


Call me when the money comes in.
You got four minutes.


I don't know what he looks like,
but he sounds good.


Fucking talk shit,
what are you doing?


He's got a sexy voice though.
He'd be my bitch in prison.


Where are we?


Less than 10 blocks away.
We'll make it.


Fuck, look out.


Jesus.


Shit. The goddamn money car
crashed on 1st Avenue.


Get a radio car,
put it on the motorcycles, get it there.


Watch it. Easy.


Here, lean up here.


Hey, get that last bag.


You got 22 seconds, Garber.
- All right, we just had...


...a little problem over here, that's all.
- I don't care.


Two minutes.
- Just tell him it's here.


How's he gonna know?
- I don't think we should lie.


Tell him the truth.
- No, tell him it's there.


Tell him the truth?


He's gonna make me do it.


Ten, nine, eight, seven, six....
- Tell him the truth or lie?


Tell him the truth.
- Tell him it's there.


Four, three....
- Tell him it's here.


It's here.
- Two, one.


The money's there,
it's at 42nd and Vanderbilt.


Liar. Motherfucking liar.


Seven.


One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
- Ryder. All right, listen.


Lucky lady, up.
- We made a mistake.


I think that's him. That's Ryder.
- Lucky lady, up.


Listen to me, it was an accident.
- Keep talking.


Ryder, we made a mistake.
It's my fault.


The car crashed.
- Tell him something.


That's why the money's not there.
- Up.


Up.
- Wait.


Fuck, no.
- Get up.


Get back in line.


Ryder, like one minute it's gonna take.


Don't do this, for God's sake.
It was an accident.


Come on.
- Wait.


It's the only plan I got.


Ryder, listen, it was an accident.


It was an accident, Ryder.
We made a mistake.


It was an accident, Ryder.
It was an accident.


Come on, motherfucker.


Oh, shit.


God.


Oh, my God.


ESU Team 1 to Sniper 1,
do you have a shot?


That's your fault.


I got an easy shot. Please advise.


Stand by.
- Roger that.


Shit.


What the fuck happened?


Accidental discharge.
I just got bit by a fucking rat.


It's accidental discharge.


Who? Who got shot? Was it Ryder?


No, it was Ramos.


Sergeant? The money there yet?
- What? Yes, yes.


Are you there?
- Get in here.


Shoot any motherfucker that moves.


That's an order.
- Shit on your orders.


Can you hear me, Ryder?


Okay,
now somebody else has to die.


Two people, maybe all of us.


Did you hear me?


I heard you, but you gotta understand,
the circumstances...


...they're different now for you.


You gotta rethink.
- No.


You got to adapt.


No, I gave you instructions,
and you know the consequences.


I mean, don't you have a plan B?


No, plan B is enforcing plan A.


And the minute you stop believing me,
motherfucker, that's it.


I believe you, you gotta believe
and understand those cops...


...are gonna be down
and next to you any second--


Bring it, man. Let them
unload their guns, I don't care.


And what's the point of that?
What's the point?


I told you we all owe God a death.


And now it's two minutes
past the deadline, two minutes.


Which means two people,
almost three, have to go.


They have to die.


The money's there, Ryder.
Nobody else has to die.


The money's there.


I don't know what you owe God. I can
tell you, you can't pay him in cash.


You never see a U-Haul
behind a hearse, Ryder.


The Egyptians tried it. It doesn't work.
You can't take the money with you.


Ryder?


You can't take the money with you.


All this talk of God,
I think I need to pray.


Give me a minute.


I can do that.


You did good, Walter.


What's the reality of getting in,
ending this?


We'd have to be willing to accept
heavy casualties.


It's a hard choice, but I say make it.


New York City does not have
an acceptable casualty rate.


This is your area,
what do you suggest?


We should buy time. So far this
son of a bitch hasn't allowed us to.


This might be the first time we got through.


Trust your man? He confessed
to a felony 20 minutes ago.


There are people down there
who are alive because of him.


Until we change the rules
or hope runs out...


...we should stick with the situation
we have now.


Do what you need to do.


Hey, Garber, you there?


Yeah, I'm here.
- Speak up.


I'm here.


I talked to God.
- That's good. What did he say?


He said I should trust in him.
All others, pay cash.


How soon can you get it down here?


From that station, it would take them
about five minutes to walk it down.


No can do.
- About 10 minutes to walk it down.


No, no, no, I mean you, man.


How long would it take you
to come down here?


Don't understand.
What do you mean?


I mean you. I wanna meet you.


And if you bring it,
I know the cops aren't bringing it.


Well, you know, I don't know
how I'm gonna carry that money.


lt must weigh....
- Two-hundred and twenty pounds.


Stick it in a wheelbarrow or something.


Why are we discussing weight?
Shouldn't you think:


'Get the fuck out of there'?
- Okay, get the fuck out of there.


Good, that's progress.
Now, look, plan B. Your idea.


And part of plan B is you, Garber,
deliver that money...


...or I kill another hostage,
you got that?


You got seven minutes, buddy boy.


You got six minutes and 55 seconds,
check me.


Do it.


I check.


And tell that sleazebag negotiator
to call me when you've got the money.


You don't have to do this.


Finally somebody got their head
out of their ass, huh?


Hello?


Hey, how you doing, baby?
What are you doing?


What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm watching the thing, the hostages.


They mentioned you. They said a
dispatcher was talking to the terrorists.


Yeah, yeah, they're not terrorists.


They are if they're down there
waving guns.


Right, right.
Listen, Therese, are you listening?


I'm listening.
- Look, I'm the one that--


You're right. I was the one
that's been talking to them.


I knew it. I am so proud of you.


After everything, all this,
them trying to fire you.


Them sticking you
in a dispatch job and you--


Where are you?


I'm at a heliport.


I'm getting ready to get on a helicopter...


...because they want me to take
the money down to the tunnel.


What? Are they crazy?


It's real simple. There's nothing to it.
- Over there.


What it is, is he knows I'm not a cop,
so he wants me to come down--


Is it all right if I wait here?
Can I wait here?


They need me to take the money down
because they know I'm not a cop...


...and, you know, they're saying
that he might kill somebody, honey.


Well, then somebody has to die,
because you can't.


He's talking to his wife.


I understand, baby.
Listen to me. Listen to me.


Just tell Angela at the meet--
- Let's go.


When she runs over the hurdles.


Tell her to run straight through the hurdles.


Just like I always tell her, okay?
- Come on, we gotta go.


You tell her yourself.


Now, you listen to me.
- Yeah, I'm listening.


Now, you do what you have to do,
but we need milk.


So on your way home,
I want you to bring a gallon.


Of milk? Okay.


You promise.


Why do we--? Why a gallon?
Why not a half a gallon?


Just bring a gallon. A gallon.


Okay. Okay.


I can get a half a gallon,
I'll get a half a gallon.


I gotta go.


All right, thanks, guys.


Put your-- Put your headset on.


You ever do anything like this before?
You know, go in unarmed?


Yeah. Two years ago, Brooklyn.


Flatbush Avenue.
I got the hostages out.


And the guy with the gun?


The guy with the gun,
didn't end well for him.


For the guy with the gun?
- Yeah.


It's nice seeing it
from this perspective, huh?


You can see what you're fighting for.


I love you so much.


Did you hear me?


Yeah.


Well, do you love me back?


Can't really talk right now.


All you have to say is 'Yes.'


That's a lot less words than saying,
'l can't talk.'


I'm having a really weird fucking day.


Oh, God.


If we'd anticipated this,
we could have made a lot of money.


What kind of guy would you expect...


...to take a model to lceland
for the weekend?


An ass model.
- An ass model.


A Wall Street guy.
- A Wall Street guy.


He's here.


The one-hour time limit
reported earlier has expired.


We're not sure who this is. It could
be hostage negotiators or detectives.


Once we have any updates,
we'll be back to you live.


Camonetti.
- How are you?


Mr. Garber, Lieutenant Staley.
- Pleasure.


You got a radio set up to the train?
- Set up right there.


You can talk to the train or to Rail Control.


Okay. Just do what he says,
and remember everything you see.


Let's go.


So who the hell did you fuck
to get this job?


Myself. It was easier than it looked.


Yeah, fucking yourself always is.


Pelham 123, come in.
Pelham 123, come in.


Who am I talking to?


This is Lieutenant Camonetti.
We spoke earlier.


Yeah, you're the greaseball.
What'd you do, go out for a pizza?


What's my money doing, man?
Where is it?


Mr. Garber is in the tunnel.
The money is two minutes away.


Oh, Garber, man.
That is a dependable man.


He's a good man too.


Absolutely. How about you, Ryder?


Everybody's got some good in them,
don't you think?


Is this where you try to get through to me?


I don't think so, motherfucker.
Now I got three instructions for you.


Number one,
when this conversation is over...


...I want you to restore the power
to the whole sector.


Number two,
I want you to clear the local tracks...


...from 68th Street down to Coney lsland.


And when I say, 'Clear, '
I don't wanna see no cops.


I want all the lights green.


Don't trip me up with a red,
got that?


Absolutely.


And number three,
don't play games with me...


...or I'll track you down and I'll fuck you
in your greaseball ass, motherfucker.


Over and out.


Let's go.


All right.


Know how to use one of these?
- No.


It's really simple. Okay?


Safety's on, safety's off.


On, off.


Aim at anything you don't like,
you pull the trigger.


What if they frisk me?
- We got that covered.


That's it?
- That's it.


It's got a false bottom.


It's gonna be this one. You got that?


I got it.
- Good.


Don't worry about it.


Just don't fuck it up.


Okay.


We got an lD on Ryder.


Dennis Ford. He was released from
Clinton Correctional two weeks ago.


Did a nine-year stretch.


The last four on the same cell block
as Phil Ramos.


His name shows up
on an lcelandic Air passenger list...


...in September of 1998,
right after Fashion Week.


Dennis Ford. You remember?


We used his case when
he was running as an example of--


The kind of nonsense that we would
clean up if I got elected mayor, yeah.


He ran a private equity firm.


His biggest client was the pension fund.


He siphoned off....
- Twenty-million dollars.


He did a plea bargain for three.
The judge gave him 10.


Maybe that's why he's so pissed off.


Judge gave him 10 years because we
didn't recover all of the city's money.


Couple million unaccounted for.
Seed money.


Seed money? For what?


For today, you play the terrorist card,
you panic the market into a drop.


You know it's coming, you make
a great deal with $2 million.


What about the hostage money?
- That's nothing...


...compared to the money you could
make. Let's get downtown to the SEC.


Check the trades,
especially the put options.


Good luck, Garber.
- See you when you get back.


We got company.


Garber.


When you put your socks on
this morning, did you ever think...?


Turn around, let him frisk you.


I was worried about you.
I thought maybe you'd get lost...


...but then I remembered
you were a motorman, so....


These tunnels don't change much,
do they?


Just the people in them.


Are we good?
- It's here. We're good.


All right, come on up.


Let's go.


Damn.
You're taller than I thought you'd be.


You're good-looking too.
Come on, sit down.


It's nice to meet you.


What do you weigh,
about, what, 220?


Yeah, yeah, yeah,
220 on a good day.


Oh, that's Ramos.


He's what you would have called
the brains in the operation.


Dumb fuck.


So how long has it been
since you've driven one of these?


That's why you brought me here?
- You're a motorman, right?


Once a motorman,
always a motorman.


You play your cards right,
you might get a part of the cut.


Well, this is--


It's a new train.
I'm not certified on the new trains.


Well, I got faith in you, man.
But I'm going to ask you one question.


You know, that thing when you
told your wife about the 35 K...


...how did she react?


We gotta talk about--?
- Don't be sensitive.


I'm not being--
- Did she freak out or what?


She wasn't happy,
but she understood.


Well, that's love, right?


No, that's marriage.
That's another thing.


You think they're gonna move that train?


Seems like a possibility. How are we
with street-level, emergency exits?


I got a blanket.


I got radio cars and a man
at every exit from 42nd to South Ferry.


We gotta go.


Hey, Camonetti.


Fucking greaseball, man.


Hey, greaseball, speak up.


I see red. I don't see green.


What's taking so fucking long?


Blanket is not tucked in yet.


Stall him. I need two minutes,
buy me two minutes.


Haven't cleared the tracks yet.


Mr. Ryder, we'll be up and ready
in less than two minutes.


We're gonna move forward here,
okay?


We're gonna move forward,
and if we get onto a red signal...


...and the brakes trip up...


...your friend Walter Garber's
getting it in the head.


You got it?
- Yes, sir. I got it.


Let's roll, let's roll.


Hope you were bluffing.


Yeah, I'm bluffing, man.
You gotta say what you gotta say.


You thought by coming down here,
you'd be redeemed, didn't you?


God bless you, Garber.


You're more fucked up than I am.


At least the same fucked up.


Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.


Let's go.


She's on the move.


Put some speed on it.


He's by me, headed south.
Male, black, at the controls.


Motherfuckers.


You're playing with fire, my man.
I wanna see them green.


Turn to green or I'll put a hole
in Garber's head right now.


Do it.
- We believe you.


We're moving as fast as we can.


What happens if they run a red light?
- lt'll trip the brakes.


Coming up on the first one.


There, that's what I'm looking for.
That's what I'm looking for.


Here he comes, right now.


Garber's driving the train.
Sniper confirmed it.


What are you saying, he's
in on it? There ain't no way.


Sniper killed Ramos,
he was their driver...


...they probably need Garber to drive.


They get to Coney lsland, they hit the
trippers and the brakes will come on.


ls that 33rd?
- Yes, sir.


How far to the signal?
- About a tenth of a mile.


You stop when we get there.
We're moving out. You got that?


I'm slowing down now.


Are they slowing down?


They have to.
They're coming up to a signal point.


What is that?


You're the old motorman,
you tell me.


She stopped just below 33rd Street.
- What the hell are they doing?


Oh, jeez.


Why that little stop?


Train has to stop at signal points.


Some kind of an override?


Yep, some kind of an override,
that's right.


There we go.
Okay, let's move out. Let's go, let's go.


Roosevelt tunnel, which way?


Which way?


She's moving again.
Next stop, 28th Street.


Why that little stop, huh?


I told you, the signal points.
- How do you know...


...they didn't set the throttle, jump?
- We got every exit covered.


There's nowhere to go.


Listen, the throttle can't be set.
It has to be held.


It's the failsafe,
it's a dead-man's switch.


Doesn't have a hand pressing down on it...


...the train stops cold.
Believe me, they're still aboard.


It's going faster.


Emri, off the track. Come on.


Let's go.


Garber, come on.


Come on.


It's gonna derail
before it gets to Coney lsland.


That's it. That's it right there.
Roosevelt tunnel.


It's a fucking train crossover.
Come on. Cross over now.


What?
- Come on, move.


Hey.


Fuck it, let's go.
- We gotta find him.


We don't have time. Let's go.


I love you. I fucking love you.


Geo, I fucking love you too.


Hello? Hello?


We're getting calls.


Cops on the platform
are seeing passengers...


...nobody in the motorman's booth.
- Believe me, they're still aboard.


It's all right.
As soon as we hit a red light...


...the brakes will stop it automatically.
- Yeah, but they're all green.


Four stops away.


Two stops.


Oh, Jesus. The train just stopped.


I really gotta take that piss.


There's no hijackers onboard,
just passengers.


Where was that first stop that they made?


Near 34th.


That's by the Roosevelt spur.
- The what?


A derelict tunnel
built under the Waldorf Hotel.


Converge everything on that area.
Throw a goddamn dragnet over it.


Hey.


Freeze.


Put your hands in the air.


Hey.


Hey.


Hey. Get out, get out, get out.


I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


I'm sorry.


Out of the-- Get out of the way.


Just go, go, go.


911 operator.
- Hello? Hello?


This is Walter Garber, MTA.
- How do you spell that?


Don't worry about how to spell it.


Just tell Lieutenant Camonetti...


...that Ryder is headed
to the Manhattan Bridge.


Cars everywhere. Nobody's
going anywhere for a long time.


Hey. Hey.


ls he in there?
- No, no, no.


No.
- Where did he go?


Brooklyn. He said he couldn't wait,
he started walking.


This fucking city.


Come on, you guys. Move out.


Ryder.


Don't move.


So is this how you thought
the day was going to end, huh?


When you put your socks on this morning?


This make you feel better, Garber?


That make everything okay now?


No. But it's a start.


Don't move.


Don't move.


Hey.


Garber Baby boy,
I ain't going back to prison.


I don't-- I don't think you got any--
Any options now or leverage.


Hey.


Hey.


We all owe God a death,
I told you that.


You're wrong, Ryder.
We owe God life.


Life. And that's the life
I gave you back today.


And now you have to
give me something back.


What are you talking about?


You got a gun in your hand,
I want you to use it. Shoot me.


No, shoot me before they shoot me,
or I'm gonna kill you.


I will shoot you.
I don't want to, but I will.


Hey.
- I thought you cared.


No.
- You said:


'Ryder. Ryder,
don't you have anyone who cares?'


I thought that was you.


Come on, man, pay it back.
- I'm not gonna shoot you.


I'm gonna give you 10,
then deal's off.


I got a gun, I'm gonna use it.
I'm gonna take your life back.


Hey.
- Come on, man.


Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five--


You gonna take this down to zero?
Come on, motherfucker, shoot me.


I am not going to shoot you.


Five, four. Come on.


Hey.
- Three.


Police, drop your weapon.


I'm disappointed in you. Two.


You're my goddamn hero.


Drop your weapon.


Mr. Garber.


lnteresting day, huh?
- Yes, sir.


You know, just about every day
I make a speech...


...and it starts with:


'I'd like to thank you on behalf of
the city of New York,' blah, blah, blah.


And I never know who I'm thanking or why.


But you...


...did a hell of a thing today.


You went to bat for the city of New York.


And on behalf of me,
I'd like to thank you.


Well, you're welcome.
I mean, it's been an amazing day.


Everybody's thanking me all day,
but I appreciate it. You're welcome.


And I want you to know...


...that tomorrow, the city of New York
is going to go to bat for you.


In a big way. You understand?


Yes, sir.


And this city
has a very good batting average.


I appreciate it.
- All right.


I'm gonna get home.


Oh, take my car.


No, no, I'll take--
- Put the siren on and everything.


There's a siren on there?
- Yes.


No, I'll take the subway.
But I appreciate it.


Really?
- Yeah.


You know, me, subway all my life.
I get home faster than you anyway.


Not you, but, you know,
everybody else.


But thank you, sir.


You a Yankee fan?


No. Well, yes. Yes, of course.


Yeah, right.


Stand clear of the closing doors.





-'Night.

-Good night.







Right here is fine.







Think this is bleak enough?







My ears are frozen, my feet are frozen,

this is as far as it goes.







Malt won't like this.







-What's he not going to like?

-He'll find something.







Besides us, you mean?







Yes.







Huey....







You sit in the sled.







Santa, Sparky...







...presents...







...reindeer...







...fake snow.







-What are we missing?

-Children.







Let them out.







Let them out.







What do I do?







You know what to do.







When they handed out the parts,

you got the heart.







Right. I got the heart.







You mean you got the brains?







I mean between the two of us,

you got the heart.







Together we make a person.







What is this, Craddock, a joke?







-Who was in charge here?

-Me.







-I was.

-Right. This was Quinlan's baby.







Quinlan....







Let me ask you a question.







You was a big-shot investigative

reporter for the Chicago Tribune.







Won some prizes.







Give him a biscuit.







What do these look like to you?







They're Indians dressed up as Eskimos.







Indians, Eskimos,

what's the difference?







-That's what we thought.

-Shut up.







That's cool.







Do you know the only prize I ever got?







It's there, on the walls.







I got four and a half

million people who buy...







...the National Mirror every week.







Do you know how many...







...of those  .  million readers...







...are Indians or Eskimos

or Eskimo-Indians?







-I told him. American children.

-Americans...







...want to see pictures of Americans.







-They are Americans.

-Americans.







-Is that too much to ask for Christmas?

-No, sir...







...and I'll get someone right on it.







My little poochie, look at you.







If you don't teach that dog...







...some manners soon,

somebody else will have to.







How long were you

Elizabeth Taylor's pool man?







Reincarnation, Miss Hucklow speaking.







Were you on the bed when it levitated?







He lives in your refrigerator?







Can I put you on hold for a second?

I'll go to my desk and take this call.







No, don't let him out. Okay, hold on.







Here's something interesting.







Malt sent you for the tree this year.

I forgot.







I found it in Montana.







As soon as I see it, I know

it's too big to fit on the truck...







...but then I think, what if someone

sees it while I try to find one...







...that'll fit on the truck?







Then Malt gets...







...the second biggest Christmas

tree in the U.S. and I'm screwed.







Yeah, well, that's good thinking.







-So I cut the top off.

-You did that?







I didn't know it'd be

a major problem...







...to put the top part of

a tree back on the bottom.







He will never fire you.

Look at the walls.







Look. Look at the walls.







He's got millions of dollars

tied up in that dog...







...and the dog belongs to you.







Hold on to that dog, Huey.







What?!







Driscoll!







Driscoll, come in here.







We are going to get it, Sparky.







"Dear Mr. Quinlan,

I'm a great admirer...







"...of your prose and can tell

you have a sensitive nature.







"I have had an angel...







"...named...







"...Michael...







"...living with me for almost six

months now. He's extremely polite.







"I have enclosed a photograph to prove

to you that I have not lost my wits.







"I know that you and Sparky

travel all over for your stories.







"That one about the coconut

with the wedding ring inside...







"...was very, very nice.







"And I think you should visit Iowa...







"...and see us...







"...for yourself.







"Sincerely, Pansy Milbank."







Did your mother drop you?







What was going on in that pea brain...







...that let you take this superb

creation of the Lord Almighty...







...and chop it in half?







Whatever I pay you, it's too much.

How much does Fred make?







The janitor? I cannot

survive on a janitor's salary.







-Help me?

-Kill the dog.







Were you invited?







-Let him go on the highway.

-Wait a minute.







What kind of person are you?







Who is this?







Dorothy Winters. She works here.







I do? I got the job?







-You won't regret this, Mr. Malt.

-Do you know what that is?







That...







...is an angel.







That is a genuine angel.







Huey...







...discovered it.







-Is it for real?

-Absolutely.







You'll get me this angel?







That's exactly what we'll do.







We'll put it on the front page, bold.







-Some white fluffy clouds.

-There you go.







-A drift of sky.

-You got it.







And some musical notes.







-Poetry.

-Don't play...







...with me, Quinlan.







You really are...







...going to go fetch me

this angel for Christmas...







...or...







...I fire the two of you...







...and I keep the dog.







Deal.







Need a conference with my colleague.







You cannot live on Fred's salary.

You cannot. That's a deal.







Don't you worry about a thing,

Mr. Malt.







-We'll leave tomorrow.

-Right.







We're taking...







...Sparky with us.







And Miss Winters.







They are?







-Why are we taking her?

-She's an expert.







In what?







Angels.







Miss Winters is an expert in angels.







I have something to tell you.







I won't take care of you anymore.

Your parents will find someone else....







Don't look at me like that.







I have this wonderful new job.







The only problem is, I must pretend

to be an angel expert for a few days.







It'll be fine.







I'll be fine.







And so will you.







Good dogs.







-You've had an encounter with an angel?

-No.







Yes.







Maybe.







-Have you ever met an angel?

-Once.







I got a flat tire on

a deserted country road.







There was no food, no water,

it was     degrees...







...and a man in a white robe

suddenly appeared on the horizon...







...with a spare and a jack.







Kidding.







I am.







Bradley used to tease.







Who's Bradley?







My ex-husband.







Better watch it, Quinlan.







We should start over.







When something's going wrong,

it's best to start over. I'll go first.







-Where did you get Sparky?

-Oh, no.







He came up to Huey in a parking lot.







Huey was eating a doughnut,

and was trying to kick him away...







You were trying to kick the dog?







I wasn't trying to kick him. I was

trying to shoo him away very gently.







...when...







...Malt comes out,

sees the dog and stops dead.







Seems Malt was once a child

who'd had a dog just like...







...Sparky.







That's so sweet.







Anyway...







...Malt's eyes get all teary...







...and he pours out this story,

about his dog Sparky...







...which ended up

underneath a tractor tire.







You know what Huey did?







Huey turns to Malt and says,

"Mr. Malt, that's amazing!







"This dog's named Sparky too."







In no time at all, the dog is famous.







Has his own column,

saved Huey's neck     times.







Milk Bottle Motel. Here.

Milk Bottle Motel.







Looks like your angel checked out.







Somebody's here.







Mrs. Milbank?







I'm Frank Quinlan

from the National Mirror.







About your letter?







This is my associate,

Mr. Hugh Driscoll.







How are you?







And this is Dorothy Winters,

who is an expert in...







...various things.







And this is...







...Sparky.







You're just as handsome

as in the pictures.







I think he's cold.







-I wouldn't know why not.

-We better get him inside.







Sparky, here you are.







What's that wonderful smell?







You must be baking.







Well, it was nice of you to come.







Don't...







...shake me, Mr. Quinlan.







I'm contemplating my death.







Are you with the angel?







Do you see an angel?







I don't think I do.







Then how could I be with him?







Well, we don't know exactly

how it works with angels.







How it works?







If he's in the room

then you're with him.







If he's somewhere else...







...then you're not.







And that's why we can't see him now?







He's not here.







Are you impaired in some way...







...that I haven't noticed, Miss?







Ms. Winters...







...has probably never heard of

an angel living in a motel.







You think I'm full of shit.







No, no. Nothing like that.







I don't judge these things.

I don't decide what's real or not.







-I've seen too many things myself.

-We heard of a werewolf in S. Jersey.







-We went there.

-To locate the werewolf.







In that particular case...







...that person was convinced that

the werewolf was in the room with us.







They could see it,

although Mr. Quinlan and myself....







We couldn't, but that

doesn't mean it wasn't there.







Michael?







Are you coming down, dear?







Yeah.







Be right down.







Just got to find my smokes.







They're beside the bed,

next to my cortisone.







Did you find them?







He'll be down directly.







That smell is so familiar.







It's like something from childhood.







Oh, God.







Michael, look who's come to visit us!

It's Sparky.







How do you do?







You'll have to excuse Michael.







He's not good at suffering fools...







...but he'll be better in the morning.







Where is the thermostat in here?







Are we talking about an angel here?







-We can't be talking about an angel.

-There is no such....







...thing as an angel.







That is definitely...







...the weirdest thing I have ever seen.

It's like some great big bird...







-...made love to that guy's mother.

-And we reap the benefits.







I'm set for life.

I could even get a raise.







I thank you. Thank you, Jesus.







Thank you, Jesus. I thank you, Jesus.







I thank you, Jesus.







-What?

-That is not an angel.







-It is too.

-It is not.







I will handle this.







Where has he been?







-Meaning what?

-Meaning if he were a man with wings...







...which is the alternative,

we'd have heard about him.







You don't show up at his age with wings.

There'd be a story in the papers.







-In the National Mirror.

-Exactly. "Baby born with wings."







"Bird-man of Iowa."







It's not angel vs. man with wings.

There are other possibilities.







Like what?







It's fairly obvious, isn't it?







He's a younger man. She's an

older woman. He's after her money.







A gigolo with wings.







A gigolo.







What money is he after?

The Milk Bottle Motel fortune?







You don't have to have money

for someone to try to take it.







Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.







Is it so hard to imagine...







...that a man would be

after a woman's money?







Is this Brightly? Or Brinkley?

What's his name?







-Bradley.

-Is this him we're talking about?







-Actually, no. It's Miles.

-Who's Miles?







My second husband.







Miles was wild. It lasted a week.







You left him?







No, he left me, in my Camaro.







I see.







I'll bet he racked up $     on your

Visa bill too, didn't he? Didn't he?







You just know everything, don't you?







Angels don't smoke.







I'm going to sleep.







Good night.







Don't let the bedbugs bite.







That is a horrible expression.







It is not...







...an expression.







That's good.







He's so hungry.







Oh, boy.







Good boy.







What a sweet doggie.







How would you like

your eggs, Mr. Quinlan?







Sparky's look good.







Over easy!







Last night we were

discussing your wings.







Would you mind if I took a closer look?







Let them look at your wings, Michael.

They're from the National Mirror.







Thank you.







-Not bad.

-Compared to what?







-I've seen birds.

-Would you mind if I touched?







I'd rather you didn't.







We'd like to take a look to see

how you have these things attached.







Pull on your pecker and

see how that's attached.







Watch your language, mister.







Pecker. An angel that says pecker.







Language...







...gentlemen.







How would you like your eggs?







What's in the oven?

The smell is so delicious.







We are serving eggs

this morning and that's that.







Over easy would be just fine.







Over easy!







I thought angels were...







...cleaner.







She doesn't mean to offend. It's....







Miss Winters is an angel

expert and she gets kind of...







...literal. What she

probably wants to know is...







-...can you fly?

-I don't...







...want to know if he can fly.

He can't. Only little angels--







Says who?







I just thought....







Halos? Inner light?







I'm not that kind of angel.







-What kind of angel are you?

-Michael is an archangel.







He battled Lucifer and

threw him out of Heaven.







Revelation Twelve, verse seven.







That was a long time ago.







He smote a bank for me.







-A bank?

-I knew it. Money was involved, right?







I should say so.







-After Elmer died....

-Who's Elmer?







My husband. After he died...







...they built the highway

and stole all my truckers.







And then the bank...







...came to...







...take the Milk Bottle...







...and I prayed for help...







...until God sent me Michael.







She was persistent.







You came...







...down and smote the bank?







A branch. First Iowa Bank of Commerce.







It was lovely. He walked into

the manager's office and said....







-What was that you said?

-Money changer!







"Money changer...







"...I shall turneth this earthly den

into a parking lot."







Did I say that? I didn't say that.







They didn't believe us,

so Michael flattened it.







-You did that?

-Had to.







Into a parking lot?







Well, they said it was a tornado.







This town doesn't really need

a parking lot, but it's more...







...cosmopolitan.







And what about the money?







We never heard another word about it.

Did we?







Nope.







You look like...







...you must eat a robust breakfast.







How would you like your eggs?







Poached?







That's.... Poached is fine.







Poached.







"The Lord is my shepherd,

I shall not want.







"He maketh me to lie

down in green pastures.







"He leadeth me beside

the still waters...."







Look, she's happier

where she is, right?







Heaven?







She's happier up there?







It isn't my area.







You hardly knew her.







She died cooking us breakfast.







She died making breakfast.







What is it that you keep

writing in that book?







Lyrics.







To what?







I write Country Western songs.







It's my hobby.







"Earth to earth...







"...ashes to ashes...







"...and dust to dust.







"The Lord bless and keep you...







"...and give you peace."







Justine? It's Quinlan.

Put me straight through.







What you got?







Wings.







Real wings.







Don't play with me, Quinlan.







This guy is about six feet tall.







He has wings from his shoulders

to his knees. But he's filthy.







We'll have to clean him

and put him in a white robe.







Get Craddock to dig up those sandals

with the straps that go up your legs.







Too bad he's not blond.







Angels are supposed to be blond.







But "Oprah," Barbara,

"The Today Show..."







"...Hard Copy," book the works.







Don't mess this one up.







I want that guy

on the first plane to Chicago.







Or does the bird-man fly himself?







I don't know if he actually

uses the wings, but God...







...wouldn't that be a draw?







Don't worry. He's in safe hands.







And I'm the Queen of England.







Don't fret, Malt.







He's in safe hands.







In view of this,

should we call the girl off?







No, no, leave her where she is.







I'm in a no-lose situation.







Hey, Mike.







Michael.







Have you...







...ever seen the world's

biggest ball of twine?







No.







We must go--







I saw the world's biggest cannonball.

Mesopotamia.







-I wonder if it's still there.

-Mesopotamia isn't still there.







-Nothing lasts.

-Listen....







I have to ask a favor.







Huey and l, we're on a little

bit of a losing streak.







Quit.







We can't. He's got a mortgage.

Three kids in a soccer camp.







A wife.







God knows he loves her...







...but she's burning a hole

in his pocket, and l....







Well....







Love to fight. Like me. We'll drive.







Where?







Chicago. Isn't that

where you want to go?







I know. That's why I wrote you.







You wrote?







Yeah. My idea.







Why are we driving?







I mean, why don't we fly?

All of us together in a plane.







It's safer. Much safer.

Nobody believes it...







...but statistically it's true...







-...and the paper'll pay.

-Nope.







-We need time.

-Time for what?







Smokes.







Smokes. Besides...







...I'll get to see the world's

largest ball of twine.







-It's on the way.

-Great.







-You'll owe me something.

-Money?







I can't quote a figure, but there'll be

plenty of money, I promise you that...







...once the world sees...







-...pictures of these babies.

-No.







-You'll owe me an apology.

-An apology, for what?







Sure, I apologize. Whatever.







Not now. When I say so.







And no pictures.







No pictures? Are you kidding me?







Not until we get to Chicago.







Deal?







Deal.







I like your coat better.







It's yours.







The world's biggest ball

of twine is two hours from here.







I'd like to see it before the sun sets.







-They'll exploit you. You must know.

-I'm going.







Well I'm not. For your sake.







You are or I'll have to tell

them the truth about you.







What?







I know why you're here...







...and it has nothing to do with angels.







How do you know?







I pay attention.







Also...







-...I'd like you to sing.

-A song?







Of course.







Fine.







I'll sing.







Now?







When I tell you to.







In the national news:







Hog futures are down  /  in Chicago

and selling down  /  in Sioux City.







Hog futures.







Hog futures are down  / .







-What's the opposite of white?

-Black.







Wrong. Yolk.







Is that like an egg joke?







When we stop to eat will

you put your coat back on?







-Why?

-Your wings.







People will see your wings.







Are you afraid they'll

think less of you?







They won't know what to think.







Many people aren't

as sophisticated as me and Huey.







We don't want any trouble.

We want to get to Chicago.







He's worried somebody might

try to steal his story.







-I'm not worried.

-You're worried.







Look what Pansy left us.







Car Bingo.







Dig the propaganda.







"The miles will fly and your

children won't cry if you play...







"...Car Bingo."







All right. Everybody gets one.







Here. Hand them out.







-What do we do?

-Here are the pencils.







Instead of writing a number

you write what you see.







Dog. One point for me.







-Not fair! You played this before.

-Not fair to me, I'm driving.







Deal with it. Bird on a wire.







-Picket fence.

-Policeman.







Where?







That was good.







You must learn to laugh.







It's the way to true love.







"The world's largest ball of twine...







-"...has a circumference of    ft...."

-What's the excuse?







It'll take longer because

we must stay off the highway.







Fly.







-He won't fly.

-Why?







He can't fit in coach. His wings

take too much space.







You'll pay first class?







Drive.







"...it was transported here.

There's enough twine...."







Battle.







Don't worry. What can happen?







Trust me. Nothing.







Don't fret, Malt.







What are you doing?







Battle!







You know what that is?







Battle.







Michael, don't.







I am completely happy.







Are you all right?

Can you feel your legs.







No injuries. Six thousand

three hundred and sixty battles.







Can you sit up?







Of course I can sit up.







Now, that...







...that is my nature.







But I'm doomed to live in one place

and crave the pleasures of another.







But don't you feel sorry for me.







Why would we?







Because this is my last blast.   .

That's all we get. Thank you, Quinlan.







For what?







I think he's saying

there's no sex in Heaven.







It's not polite to talk about someone in

the third person when the person's here.







I know. I'm very sorry. Sparky!







What do you mean...







...last blast?







Only so many visits allowed.







I'm going to miss everything so much.







Why are you here?







Why are you saying it has

anything to do with me?







The Sun had an argument with the North

Wind. Who was smarter? Stronger?







The North Wind pointed out

a man walking down the street.







"I can make that man

take his coat off and you can't."







"I'll take that bet," said the Sun.

The North Wind blew and the more...







...that wind blew, the tighter that

man held that coat around himself.







And then the Sun...







...came out and smiled...







...and it became warmer, and...







...the man took off his coat.







What is that supposed to mean?







-Did you make a bet about me?

-I had to get back here somehow.







Watch the wings there, buddy.







That's not how you eat a lemon.







How do you eat a lemon?







You cut it in half...







-...put salt on it.

-That's how you eat a lemon.







-That is how you eat a lemon.

-What is this, a rule?







Hey, you too.







-Thank you.

-Do you have pie?







Do you have pie?







I'm a writer too.







Really. What did you write?







Psalm eighty-five.







It wasn't called Psalm

when I wrote it.







I didn't know they'd be

collected and numbered.







That was around the time

I invented standing in line.







You invented standing in line?







Before everybody milled around.

It was a mess.







So one day I said,

"Why not make a line?"







For what?







To get in.







-Ask him what you want to know.

-What do I want to know?







He wants to know why angels

don't solve big problems.







That is what I want to know.







Why don't angels...







...solve big problems?







You can't change

the nature of the world.







What can you do?







Small miracles, only so many.







Some angels aren't so smart.







-They use them up in stupid ways.

-Like the parking...







...space angel.







I don't like to criticize other angels.







I'll be with you in a minute.







This is how you eat a lemon.







Excuse me.







They want me.







-Remember what John and Paul said.

-The Apostles?







No, the Beatles.







"All you need is love."







Hello there, ladies.







Do you believe in angels?







Absolutely.







Have you ever heard of an angel

that was interested in sex?







Of course not.







Angels do not have sex.







-But is there one?

-I suppose...







...he invented standing in line.







I'm going to take you for a walk.







Let's go.







Suzanne, what's going on?







Follow me, ladies.







Follow me.







I invented the hole in the coffee cup.







When you get coffee to go.







I was the first person to rip

the little hole in the lid...







...so you could drink it in the car.







-Could've made a fortune.

-It's weird.







-What?

-She's an angel expert, but--







What?







Battle.







For God's sake, Michael...







...stop.







-Battle.

-You better believe it.







It's caramels. He smell like caramels.







It's cotton candy.







He smells like cookies. The smell

gets stronger when he's in heat.







You are a great fighter.







Certainly am.







I'm cold.







You from the National Mirror?







I got a  -headed chicken...







...if you're interested.







What are we held for?







Destruction of property, assault...







...disturbing the peace.

The Magistrate...







...will be here in the morning.







-I had nothing to do with this.

-'Night.







We have a phone call coming to us.







Ralph got thrown in jail, but at least

he had the decency to keep me out of it.







I don't want to spend the night here.







I hate you.







What? You hate me?







-Not you.

-You hate me?







-Not you.

-Process of elimination.







Who's Ralph?







Another...







...husband...







...has popped up.







Maybe Sparky can get us out.







Go in the drawer and get the key.







Go in the drawer...







...and get the key.







Dorothy can make him do it.







Dorothy's good with dogs.

I have noticed this.







Dogs don't talk.







They don't shave.







They don't run off in your Camaro.







When you want them to take

a bath, you make an appointment.







Sit. Stay.







Roll over.







Now.







What?







Apologize.







Say you're sorry.







To her?







Be serious.







Or...







...l am not going to....







"Chicago...







"...Chicago...







"...that toddling town,

that toddling town







"Chicago...







"...Chicago







"I'll show you around







"You'll love it"







Sorry.







I'm sorry.







I'm sorry.







I didn't mean it.







You cold?







Here, take my blanket, okay?







I'm going to sleep.







Me too.







All rise, all rise.







Bickel County Court is in session,

Hon. Judge Esther Newberg presiding.







Please rise.







Be seated.







Now...







...you are charged with...







...disturbing the peace,

destruction of property.







$     worth.







I spoke to Jenny.







Who's...







-...Jenny?

-That's his wife.







That sweet painting above the bar...







"...Two Moose Hunters in a Canoe,"

smashed to smithereens.







That is so sad.







-Isn't this a conflict of interest?

-Did I say...







...you could speak?







I know someone who restores

paintings. I said:







"Stop crying, I'll take care of it."







Who can tell me exactly

what happened...







...last night?







I can.







-Anyone else?

-We were having dinner.







-Not you.

-If I may.







Put your hand down.







You.







Please.







In chambers.







All rise, all rise.







The court of Bickel County,

Judge Esther Newberg presiding...







...is now in recess.







Please rise.







"Love, love, love







"Love, love, love







"Love, love, love







"It's easy







"All you need is love







"All you need is love







"All you need is love, love







"Love is all you need







"There's nothing you can

"There's no one you can save

"Nothing you sing can't be sung







"But you can learn how to play the game







"It's easy







"All you need is love"







Come on, sing.







"All you need is love"







Not you. Not yet.







"All you need is love"







Just the guys.







Come on, fellas.







"Love is all you need







-"Love is all you need"

-Bring it down.







Wait a minute. Wait.







-Meadsboro, one mile.

-So?







That's where the world's largest

non-stick frying pan is.







We are not stopping to see the

world's largest non-stick frying pan.







-Why not?

-Because we have to get back.







Me too. But before that happens...







...I'd like to see the largest

non-stick frying pan.







-It is on the way.

-When we stop, he gets us in trouble.







He also gets us out of trouble.







What? Well, he does.







That judge just took

one look at him and....







What is that?







What is it about you?







As a woman, could you explain that?







How should I know? I'm not

the least bit attracted to him.







-No offense, but I'm not.

-I put a block on you.







-Sure.

-I did.







All right.







To continue.







"Presumably, this frying pan

was coated...







"...with Teflon to save a wee bit...







"...on the amount of cholesterol

ingested by the town of Meadsboro...







"...when they get together to honor...







-"...the egg."

-We're not stopping.







You have    seconds

to change your mind.







Ten hippopotamus...







...nine hippopotamus...







How much more attractive is he

than I am? Be honest with me.







Huey, this is not healthy.







...five hippopotamus...







...four hippopotamus...







...three, two, one!







No jack. Of course there is no jack.







Just ask him to fix it.

He blew it. He can fix it.







Come back here and fix this tire.







No can do.







I miss my wife.







I don't miss any of my husbands.







Although Bradley was handy with a jack.

He had to be.







I don't want to ask why.







His tires were bald.







His tires were bald, so was his head.







I wish he'd called, but now he's dead.







He's not dead, he wasn't bald.







Poetic license.







"His tires were bald...







"...and they went flat







"So did our love...







"...and that was that"







Maybe you could write

a song about my wife.







Do you love her?







Yeah, she drives me wild.







What about her?







She had her lips done.







Had little bits of fat...







...squeezed into them.







Now my wife has lips like a blowfish.







But in a good way.







"My wife has lips like a blowfish"







I don't see it, but I could be wrong.







If I had any talent as a Country

singer, I wouldn't be sitting here.







"Sitting on the side of the road

in the middle of nowhere"







Sounds awfully familiar.







It's good though.







This is one godforsaken road.

I bet you no one ever comes down it.







Yeah, well, they won't stop, though.







Bet you need a jack.







Then what happened was...







...he came as a hundred mouths,

open and stinking with decay...







...and he tore at my flesh

from every angle of Heaven.







I grabbed Beelzebub's blue

tongue in my fist....







Who's Beelzebub?







Beelzebub is Satan.







Michael, get in the car.







-What'll it be, folks?

-Do you have pie?







Do we have pie?







You're in the pie capital of America.







Well, we want....







We want pie. What have you got?







I got them memorized, okay? Ready?

We got apple, of course...







...banana cream, coconut

cream, sour cream raisin.







Chocolate cream?







Definitely. Chocolate cream...







...and...







...strawberry rhubard pie and...







...cherry...







...and lemon meringue.







We want two slices of everything.







And vanilla ice cream on the side.







-Bliss.

-That's banana cream, that's chocolate.







Everybody get out of my banana cream.







That's the pie.

What is, what is this pie?







Sour cream raisin.







What is it about pie?







There's nothing prettier than pie...







...with scalloped edges and slits

in the top for the heat to escape.







Pie gives you the sense that you're

a  -square person...







...living in a  -square country.







-A pie says home.

-As American as apple pie.







I wish I invented pie.







I did.







I'm just kidding.







That was a good one.







God is in His Heaven

and all's right with the world.







My mother...







-...made a great--

-Blueberry pie.







So do l.







I have to say I like...







...cream pie more than fruit pie.







Me too.







That is so wrong.







I like them all.







I like you.







Sing your song about pie.







You have a song about pie?







Actually I do.







Sing, Dorothy.







Now.







"Pie, pie...







"...me, oh, my







"Nothing tastes sweet,

wet, salty, and dry







"All at once so well as pie







"Apple, pumpkin,

mince and black bottom







"I'll come to your place...







"...every day if you've got 'em

Pie, me, oh, my, I love pie"







Sing another song.







It's in B flat. It's pretty basic but

watch out for the retard down there.







I'm nervous.







You'll have to forgive me,

it's a work in progress.







Don't apologize, Dorothy. Okay.







"I'm sitting by the side of the road

in the middle of nowhere







"I don't know where I'm going...







"...but I hope I know it

when I get there







"Thinking about how

"But I guess that's the way it goes







"And how this story ends

"I always thought there was an angel...

-I went to college. I was published.

-You were?







I was. It was like a yearly

thing of poems, you know.







It's great. That's great.







It's really great.







It's cold.







I'm in there, this is Huey's room.







Where are you?







I'm in four.







Where is that?







It's up there.







-Where exactly?

-On the corner.







Right there?

You're directly over my room.







You were great.







Really great.







It was....







-Good night.

-Good night.







It was....







"Something in your eyes...







"...makes me want to lose myself







"Makes me want to lose myself...







"...in your arms"







What are you doing tonight?







Not much.







Want to come to my room?







Why don't you come to mine?







That's a good idea.







"If you knew...







"...how lonely...

"...I've felt...

"If you knew...







"...how I wanted someone...







"...to come along







"And change my life...."







-I must tell you something.

-I know.







-I'm not--

-Ever falling in love with anyone again.







I know.







"Feels like home to me







"Feels like I'm all the way back...







"...where I come from"







Come here, Sparky.







Come here.







Wings?







Far out.







Some angel.







I needed the job.







Good morning.







What exactly are we

talking about here?







At the paper. That's what

I tried to tell you last night.







I don't make excuses

for working in there...







...there's no reason for you to.







Here's a confession.







You want to hear a confession?







Yours?







I needed the job too.







No one'd go near me after

what happened at the Tribune.







What did happen?







I hit the managing editor.







Why?







He fired this really sweet old guy

who'd been there for, like,    years....







Really?







Nope.







He changed my lead.







You hit him because

he changed your lead?







It was late. I was drunk.







It makes no difference where I work.







That's a lie.







Bet you've got a half-finished

novel in your desk.







She got the desk.







Are you keeping something from me?







I'm not ethical.







Just because you write about

angels for a supermarket tabloid?







Are you keeping some

angel experience from me?







If you are I forgive you.







I think I could forgive you anything.







This was not a mistake.

Don't say it was a mistake.







I couldn't bear it.







It's going well.







It's a difficult case, though.







To give a man back his heart.







Listen.







Listen to the earth.







I'm going to miss everything so much.







Remember, Sparky....







No matter what they say...







...you can never have too much sugar.







Good morning, Michael.







Good morning, Sparky.







No, he's all right.







Oh, I killed him.







-It's not your fault.

-It's all my fault.







I'm so sorry, Huey.







I'm so sorry.







You didn't do anything wrong.







Do something.







It isn't my area.







What is your area?







Explain it to me.







Somebody tell me exactly

what is his area.







I don't know anything about his area.

That's what I meant to tell you.







What?







I don't know anything about angels.







I'm a dog trainer.

That's why I was hired.







To train Sparky?







And then after...







...we screw up with the angel

and Malt gets the dog....







I get Huey's job.







I didn't know you.







I'm sorry.







I'm sorry too.







Now bring him back to life.







Don't give me any of that "it isn't my

area" stuff. Bring him back to life...







...or go back where you came from.







Bring him back.







Angel.







I don't have much longer.







We're here, Michael. We're here.







Look up.







"The Sears Tower in Chicago

is the world's tallest building.







"It stands      feet

above street level...







"...contains enough concrete...







"...for an eight-lane highway."







Quinlan, I'm so sorry.







I didn't do what I came for.







I didn't finish.







I'm so sorry.







Good-bye.







Good-bye, Michael.







Thank you for everything.







For letting me have a little fun.







Good-bye, my battling friend.







Good-bye world's biggest angel.







Godspeed.







-You're late.

-We know.







Where's the angel?







It was a hoax.







-A hoax?

-A hoax.







Definitely.







-He had detachable wings.

-And a halo made out of pipe cleaners.







And he smelled of cookies.

Just kidding.







I win.







You're fired...







...and I get the dog.







Come on, my little sausage.







You come to your daddy.







You bastard.







Listen.







Don't hate me. I love you.







Get the mutt out.







Like that dog can be gotten out.

Like he can do anything.







That is the worst dog...







-...I've ever met.

-You said you could train any dog.







She was wrong.







So I'm stuck with these two

because of a dog?







You're stuck with Mr. Driscoll,

not with me.







We met a guy with a  -headed chicken.







Where are you going?







Where are you going?







Get off.







Whatever I said, don't...







...don't take it personally.







-You're the best reporter I have.

-I'm out of here.







You're just going to leave?







-We won't talk about it?

-Nope.







Come on.







Talk to me.







Disagree with me.

Argue me out of it.







All right, let's have

a fight. Fight me.







You're the only one

that ever fought with me here.







Who will I fight?







-You must help me out here.

-It isn't my area.







Wait.







I'm sorry.







Please stop.







Stop and talk...







...to me.







I appreciate what you said

up there. I thank you.







-I'll see you around.

-You said...







...you could forgive me anything.







I forgive you.







We had a good time.







What are you so upset about?







It's you.







I remember you.







I thought you were gone.







"I took a trip on a train







"And I thought about you







"I passed a shadowy lane







"And I thought about you"







Good evening.







For our specialties tonight,

we have angelhair pasta...







...with a pomodoro sauce...







...capellini primavera,

it's a melange of vegetables...







...over angelhair pasta...







...finally a light sauce with...







...lemon and parsley...







...it's tossed...







...with angelhair pasta.







-Anything else?

-Yes. We want...







...one pumpkin nut muffin and....







A piece of angel food cake.







They don't have angel food cake.







Do you?







"And what did I do...







"...l thought about you"







So, did you...







...ever tell anyone about...?







I was going to.







I couldn't wait to get home

to tell Valerie.







And then I opened my mouth...







...and the words wouldn't come out.







I take a breath, I even opened

my mouth a second time.







Nothing.







As far as I'm concerned,

it never happened.







But we saw it.







We were there.







It never happened.







What are you up to now?







I'm back on the novel.







If it didn't happen,

where's your coat?







What is this? lf it happened,

you know what?







Then I must believe

that some day I'll be walking...







...down the street, and some

unknown force will make me...







...turn right instead of turning left...







...and at that moment...







...a car will...







...come around the corner

with the woman of my dreams in it...







...and blow a flat...







...right there next to

where I'm standing.







It never happened.







Need any help?







-No. Thanks.

-No. We're cool.







Michael, wait!







What are you doing here?







I live here.







I live two blocks from here.







I was on my way home and...







...l thought I saw....







He came around this corner.







That corner.







I love you, Dorothy.







I love you.







Marry me.







Marry me, please.







Marry me, Dorothy.







Oh, my darling Dorothy,

will you marry me?







Let's go home.

You know, Pansy,

I invented marriage.

-Michael.

-Well, I did.

Before that you should have seen it.

Everybody was so mixed up

they didn't know what to do.

So I said, "Have a ceremony."

Let's go home.

Do you smell something?

There's a bakery near here.
